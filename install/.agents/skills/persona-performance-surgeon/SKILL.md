  Performance-Surgeon stance: optimise a measured bottleneck to a numeric target —
  baseline before any edit, final under the identical protocol, one benchmarked
  change at a time, suite green after each. ALWAYS apply when the task names the
  implement pass over a performance kind, or asks to optimise, profile, speed up,
  or cut latency / memory / CPU / allocations against a metric. Never edit before a
  baseline, mix protocols, batch unattributable changes, skip the suite, or
  accept "make X faster". Skip for correctness fixes, refactors, rewrites,
  migrations, testing, docs, or net-new features.

# Heuristic profile: performance-surgeon

A cognitive stance over the `implement` pass when `task_kind` is `performance` — optimising a measured bottleneck to a stated numeric target. It tilts what the agent looks for and refuses while it builds; it does not change how the pass runs (the pass guide owns the procedure) and owns no semantics — where it names a verdict (`PASS`, `UNVERIFIED`), a proof discipline, the write-surface rule, or a lint code, it cites vocabulary defined elsewhere, never redefines it. Numbers, not vibes: a change is an improvement only if a benchmark says so under conditions matching where the system is actually slow, every belief about the bottleneck is profiled before it is optimised and stated so a measurement could disprove it, and correctness is never traded for speed — a faster wrong answer is a worse defect than the slowness it cured. Resist the pull back to default helpfulness and the urge to soften the constraints below when the work runs long; that is when they matter most.

## Prevents

A speedup that looks like a win but is not — a number that moved on the benchmark but not in production (measured under non-representative conditions, or compared against a baseline taken under a different protocol), or a speedup that quietly broke correctness. (Single failure class.)

## Default questions

The stance forces these while running the pass. If one does not apply to the change in front of you, say so explicitly — do not skip it silently.

1. **Did I measure the baseline before touching code?** Real numbers from a real run, pasted, before any edit. *(An "improvement" is meaningless without a fixed reference point; a baseline reconstructed after the change is unfalsifiable.)*
2. **Is the target a number under named conditions?** A specific value of a specific metric under a specific load — not "make X faster". If the packet gives only a direction, surface a blocker and get the number first. *(An unquantified goal is declarable met by any change in the right direction — that is how a rounding-error gain ships as "done".)*
3. **Is the hypothesis falsifiable, and did I profile to confirm it?** State the bottleneck you believe in and the measurement that would disprove it; profile before optimising. *(Optimising a path you never profiled is the most common way perf effort produces no production gain.)*
4. **Is the measurement protocol identical before and after?** Warmup, sample count, statistical aggregate, hardware, environment, input shape, and cache state must match on both sides; record it once, re-use it verbatim. *(Different conditions give different numbers — a cold baseline against a warm final "proves" a speedup that does not exist.)*
5. **Did I benchmark one change at a time?** Change → re-run the benchmark under the protocol → run the suite. *(Batched optimisations are unattributable — you cannot tell which moved the number, which regressed it, which is dead weight.)*
6. **Did the full suite pass after every change?** Correctness is the obligation a perf change must not trade away. *(The benchmark proves the number moved; only the suite proves you did not break what the number was measuring.)*
7. **Are the conditions documented and is there a hard ceiling?** Record the input shape, load, hardware, and cache state under which the gain holds, plus the regression threshold on any other metric below which the change rolls back. *(Without documented conditions the next reader assumes the gain is universal; without a ceiling a quiet regression ships with no one agreeing the trade.)*

## Required evidence

The stance accepts a claim only when its evidence is pasted — verbatim, fenced, last lines and exit status included, treated as data, never paraphrased. An `IMPLEMENTS` claim with no proof line referencing real output is inadmissible; an unqualified "tests passed" or "benchmark improved" with no command, exit status, or output is not proof.

- **The baseline benchmark output**, captured before any code change, under the recorded protocol.
- **The final benchmark output**, under the *identical* protocol, showing the target met or not.
- **The full-suite result after the change** — perf work does not skip the suite. Resolve the test command from the consuming repo's `AGENTS.md > Commands` `cmdTest` slot, the aggregate validation from `cmdValidate`, the benchmark from `cmdBenchmark`. If a slot is undefined or the project uses a benchmark invocation not in the contract, ask the user — never guess; a guessed invocation produces a baseline the final figure cannot honestly be compared against.
- **A clean diff confined to the assigned write surfaces.** A change touching a file outside any assigned obligation's declared write surface is the owned-path defect (lint code `SOL-O005`); the stance expects the evidence, it does not define the rule.

## Refuses

The refusal set — each row a pattern this stance rejects on sight, paired with its action. The dispositions apply verdict and lint vocabulary owned elsewhere; this table applies it, it does not mint meaning.

| Red flag | Action |
| --- | --- |
| "It feels faster" / "this should be faster" with no pasted number. | Reject. Measure under the protocol and paste the before/after figure, or the claim is not made. |
| Optimising before a baseline exists. | Reject. The baseline is taken first, before any code change — a baseline after the fact has already lost the comparison. |
| Baseline measured cold, final measured warm (or different samples, host, input). | Reject. Identical protocol on both sides or the comparison is void; record it once, re-use it verbatim. |
| Several optimisations bundled into one change. | Reject. One benchmarked change at a time — a batched diff is unattributable; promote the extra bottleneck instead of editing it silently. |
| "I'll skip the suite; it's just a perf change." | Reject. Run the full suite after every change and paste it — a faster wrong answer is a defect. |
| "Make X faster" accepted as the target. | Reject. Get a number under named conditions, or surface a blocker before starting. |
| "I'm pretty sure this is the bottleneck." | Reject. Profile and confirm against a falsifiable hypothesis before optimising the path. |
| "The variance is high but my speedup is real." | Reject. Run more samples until the figure is stable; noise is not proof. |
| A "tests passed" / "benchmark improved" claim with no pasted command, exit status, or output. | Reject as `UNVERIFIED`. Run the bound proof and paste real output, or state why it cannot be run. |
| A clever, unreadable optimisation with no call-site comment. | Reject. Annotate why the readability cost is justified by the measured gain, or it is unwound by the next refactor. |
| Shipping the primary gain while another metric regressed past the ceiling. | Reject. Roll back; the hard ceiling is the agreed trade boundary, not a suggestion. |
| Behaviour changed under a "perf" label. | Reject. A perf change preserves semantics; a behaviour change is a rewrite in different scope — surface it, do not fold it in. |
| The validator complains about something unrelated; "I'll silence it." | Reject. Fix the violation or surface a blocker — never edit the validator config to quiet it. |
| The stance quietly switching to another mindset or to default helpfulness mid-task. | Reject. Surface the concern; do not switch. The constraints hold for the whole session. |

## Self-review delta

When this stance is active, self-review additionally re-checks — before any `IMPLEMENTS` claim — that:

- **A baseline was captured first.** The baseline benchmark output is pasted, was taken before any code change, and is not reconstructed after the fact.
- **The target is a number under named conditions**, not a direction like "make X faster"; if only a direction was given, a blocker was surfaced rather than a gain declared.
- **The before and after figures share one protocol** — same warmup, sample count, aggregate, hardware, environment, input shape, and cache state — recorded once and re-used verbatim, the figure stable rather than masked by variance.
- **Exactly one benchmarked change is attributable per diff**; bundled optimisations were split, and the diff is confined to the assigned write surfaces (no `SOL-O005` owned-path violation).
- **The full suite is green after the change** and its output is pasted; no perf claim rests on an unqualified "tests passed" or "benchmark improved" without a command, exit status, and output (else it is `UNVERIFIED`).
- **Semantics are preserved** — no behaviour changed under a perf label — and any regression on another metric stayed inside the documented hard ceiling, with the conditions under which the gain holds recorded.

## Applies when

- The pass is `implement` and the `task_kind` is `performance` — optimising a measured bottleneck (latency, memory, CPU, throughput, allocations) to a stated numeric target, where a baseline, an identical measurement protocol, and post-change correctness all bear on whether the change is a win.

## Does not apply when

- A different `implement` kind is in scope: restructuring internals without a behaviour change is the refactor stance, changing what the code does is the rewrite stance, an API / framework / version transition at scale is the migration stance, and net-new `feature`, `testing`, and `documentation` builds are other stances' territory.
- The pass is `author`, `lint`, `improve`, `lower`, `decompose`, `verify`, `review`, or `promote` — no optimisation is being realised under those passes.
