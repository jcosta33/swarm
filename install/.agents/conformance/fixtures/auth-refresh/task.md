<!--
auth-refresh golden-corpus POSITIVE fixture — Stage 5 (work packet, passes: decompose, implement).
The `decompose` pass projects the IR into a work packet whose write surfaces are a subset of
the assigned obligations' WRITES (the two-tier lowering rule, see the `lower` pass; a packet writing a
path outside its declared WRITES is SOL-O005, G7). The `implement` pass executes it. Only the
load-bearing frame is shown. Inert oracle data — Swarm runs nothing.

# Task: Implement auth-refresh client behavior

## Scope

### In
- Implement AC-001, AC-002, and preserve I-001 within web/src/http/client.ts.

### Out
- Do not implement unassigned obligations.
- Do not change behavior outside web/src/http/client.ts.
