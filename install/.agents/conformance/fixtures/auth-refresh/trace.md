<!--
auth-refresh golden-corpus POSITIVE fixture — Stage 6 (trace, pass: verify).
The `verify` pass records a TRACE block plus the provenance the drift join depends on — the
canonical seven fields the the `verify` pass defines: source_hash
(echoing the IR node content_hash), per_surface_hash[] (each entry {surface, hash, exercised}),
adapter, verdict, tier (the PROOF TYPE per the `verify` pass, never a RISK
value), origin_obligations[], origin_traces[].
Inert oracle data; the proof results below are recorded, not executed here.
