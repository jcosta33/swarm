<!--
payment-5xx golden-corpus POSITIVE fixture — Stage 6 (trace, pass: verify).
The `verify` pass records a TRACE block plus the provenance the drift join depends on — the
canonical seven G11 fields (see the `verify` pass): source_hash (echoing the IR node content_hash),
per_surface_hash[] (each entry {surface, hash, exercised}), adapter, verdict,
tier (the PROOF TYPE — see the `verify` pass — never a RISK value), origin_obligations[], origin_traces[].
The AC-020/AC-021 `test` proofs PASS in the harness. The I-001 `monitor` proof reports a
FAIL: the production duplicate-captures dashboard observed a non-zero double-capture count
over the window — runtime evidence that the harness never saw. The harness test (AC-020) and
the production monitor (I-001) thus disagree about the same no-double-charge property, which
the `review` pass will decorate CONTRADICTED (see the `review` pass). Inert oracle data; the proof results
below are recorded, not executed here.
