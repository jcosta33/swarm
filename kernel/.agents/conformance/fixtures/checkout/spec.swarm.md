# Spec: Cart submission and checkout

<!--
checkout golden-corpus fixture — Stage 1 (authored source, pass: author).
This is the only `.swarm.` artifact a human writes; the `.swarm.` infix marks it
human-authored. It is inert oracle data: nothing runs it. As authored, it carries the
checkout domain's canonical defect class that the `lint` pass (see ../EXPECTED.md) is
expected to surface:
  - SOL-P004 (AC-010 bundles three separable obligations in one REQ — validate the cart
              AND charge the card AND email the receipt) — repaired by improve op ATOMIZE.
  - SOL-O001 (AC-011 and AC-012 share the write surface `db/orders` and are planned in the
              same parallel group, violating the safe-parallelism predicate) — repaired by
              improve op SCOPE.
The positive obligation the negative variant violates — single-charge idempotency — is the
INVARIANT I-010 carried below with a bound property proof.

## Intent
When a shopper submits their cart the service validates it, charges the card, writes the
order and inventory records, and emails a receipt — charging the card at most once.
