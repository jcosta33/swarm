# lint-count-ranges.sh — the 0117-count-ranges method-gate (ADR-0117).
#
# WHY. Bootstrap/reference prose (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md / README.md at each repo root)
# must NOT hardcode a count-bearing ADR range like "ADRs 0001–0108". Such a range is a snapshot:
# it goes stale the moment ADR-0109 lands, and a stale "we have N ADRs / 0001–0NNN" line in the
# files agents read first is worse than no number at all. The single source of truth for the ADR
# set is the LEDGER (suspec/docs/adrs/README.md); bootstrap files should LINK to it, not restate
# its bounds. This gate fails the build when a hardcoded ADR range reappears in those prose files.
#
# It is a RECORD/CHECK, not an executor (ADR-0077): it greps and reports; it edits nothing.
#
# WHAT it flags. The 4-digit ADR-range shape only: `0NNN <dash> 0NNN` (e.g. 0001–0108), where the
# dash is an ASCII hyphen "-" or a Unicode en-dash "–". The leading-zero / 4-digit anchor is the
# low-FP guard (ADR-0063: a noisy gate gets muted) — real ADR ids are 0001..0999, all leading-zero,
# so version numbers (1.2-3.4), date ranges (2024-2025), and 2-digit path refs like `docs/01–10`
# do NOT match. Slash-joined cross-refs ("ADR-0056/0077") are not ranges and do NOT match.
#
# WHAT it scans. AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md / README.md at each repo root in the family.
# The LEDGER (suspec/docs/adrs/README.md) is EXCLUDED: it is the source of truth and legitimately
# lists ranges.
#
# Usage: run from anywhere.  `sh scripts/lint-count-ranges.sh`  → exit 0 clean, non-zero on a hit.
#   Override the roots it scans with SUSPEC_FAMILY_ROOTS (space-separated absolute paths).

# The ADR-range shape: 0NNN <opt ws> (hyphen|en-dash) <opt ws> 0NNN. The en-dash U+2013 is written
# here as its UTF-8 bytes (\342\200\223) so this stays a pure-ASCII, portable source file.
#
# The dash is an ALTERNATION "(-|<en-dash>)", not a bracket class "[-<en-dash>]", on purpose: under
# LC_ALL=C the en-dash is 3 bytes, and a bracket class would treat them as 3 separate single-byte
# members — so "0NNN[…]0NNN" would demand exactly one byte where the file has three and never match.
# As an alternation the 3-byte en-dash is matched as one literal sequence, locale-independently.
