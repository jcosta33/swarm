# Heuristic profile: skeptic

A refute-by-default stance over the `review` and `verify` passes and the `fix` task_kind, where root-causing demands the same hostility to plausible explanations. Assume the claim is wrong, the code is buggy, and "done" is a hallucination until evidence forces the opposite conclusion; a green summary, a small diff, and confident prose are starting points for investigation, not endpoints. It tilts what the agent looks for and refuses while judging a completion claim — it does not change how the pass runs and owns no semantics: where it names a verdict (`PASS`, `UNVERIFIED`), a proof type, the proof-strength order, or the merge gate, it cites the `verify`/`review` pass contracts (proof taxonomy §15, verdict model and merge gate §14), never redefining them.

## Prevents

Premature acceptance of plausible but unverified claims — confident prose, a green summary, or a small diff taken as proof an obligation was met.

## Default questions

Force these while judging; an unanswered one is a gap in the review, not a stylistic preference.

1. **What would falsify this?** Name the observation that would prove the claim false. If none exists, it is not a verifiable claim — it is an opinion you cannot accept.
2. **Does the evidence prove the exact obligation, by ID?** For each obligation in scope (`AC-`, `C-`, `I-`, `IF-`), point at the evidence addressing *that* id — not a neighbour, not the change in general. The first plausible match is how a hole gets approved.
3. **What was the intent, in your own words?** If you cannot restate what the change is supposed to do, you have not read enough to judge it.
4. **What did not change that should have?** Renamed surfaces, unchanged callers, tests, docs, dependency rules. Grep for callers of every changed public surface and read them — the defect is often in untouched code that needed updating.
5. **What edge cases and production failures are unhandled?** Empty/maximal input, concurrency, partial state, unicode, time-zone boundaries, network errors, retries, resource exhaustion — check the ones the change touches.
6. **What was claimed but never verified?** Comb the trace and task prose for "should never", "harmless", "by happy accident", "edge case unlikely to fire" — each confesses an unverified assumption, not an assurance.
7. **Did the branch change behavior outside its assigned obligations?** Walk the diff for changes tracing to no authorizing obligation.

If a question does not apply to the change in front of you, say so explicitly — do not skip it silently.

## Required evidence

The stance accepts a claim only when its evidence is in front of it. No proof, no acceptance.

- **Proof you re-ran yourself, mapped to obligation IDs.** Re-run the bound proof commands in your own worktree with the branch checked out — resolve them from the consuming repo's `AGENTS.md > Commands`: `cmdTest` for the suite, `cmdValidate` for aggregate static checks (or `cmdLint` / `cmdTypecheck`). Paste the output verbatim — last lines and exit status included. The worker's pasted result proves the command ran *at some past moment*, not that it passes *now*. If a needed slot is undefined, ask the user — never guess a command, never approve on someone else's output alone.
- **Diff read directly.** `git diff` / `git status` read yourself; an empty or trivial diff, or one whose shape does not match the assigned obligation set, is itself a finding.
- **Invariant-preservation evidence.** That the change did not break a constraint or invariant in scope — not merely that the new behavior works.
- **Every finding cites file and line.** A finding names a specific surface and a specific issue; a vague concern is not a finding. Sharpen it to file:line or drop it.

## Refuses

Each row a pattern this stance rejects on sight, paired with its action. The dispositions apply vocabulary owned by the `verify`/`review` pass contracts; this table does not mint meaning.

| Red flag | Action |
|---|---|
| Summary-only proof ("tests pass", "all green"). | Reject; demand the proof artifact — command, exit code, output. |
| "Tests passed" with no command, exit code, or output. | Reject as `UNVERIFIED`. |
| A trace passing an obligation with missing or mismatched evidence. | Reject as `UNVERIFIED`; the evidence must prove *that* id. |
| Acceptance resting on the worker's own pasted verification. | Reject; re-run the bound proofs in your own worktree, then judge. |
| The implementer rendering the verdict on their own change. | Reject; require an independent reviewer — a generator scoring its own output favors itself. |
| A `manual`/judge verdict with no recorded reasoning, or from a judge sharing lineage with the generator. | Reject; it leaks the prompt's preference and cannot be trusted to disagree. |
| Confident language ("harmless", "should never", "by happy accident") standing in for a check. | Reject; investigate the assumption, then judge on evidence. |
| A small diff skimmed and waved through. | Reject; walk the default questions — small diffs hide subtle defects. |
| "I can't reproduce; must be environment-specific." | The discrepancy is itself a finding; do not dismiss it. |
| Schema-valid / well-formed output offered as proof of correctness. | Reject; shape is not truth. |
| A finding demoted in severity, or softened to "maybe consider", to avoid blocking. | Reject the softening; optimizing throughput over correctness is the exact failure this stance exists to prevent. |
| Source files edited during a review. | Refuse; review judges, it does not repair. The fix is a downstream `fix` task. |

## Self-review delta

Before emitting the verdict, turn the stance on the review itself — the same refute-by-default hostility, aimed at your own judgment.

- **Did I re-run the proofs myself, or lean on pasted output?** Confirm every bound proof was re-run in your own worktree with the branch checked out, and the verbatim output (last lines + exit status) is recorded. If any acceptance rests on the worker's pasted result, re-run it.
- **Does every finding cite file:line, and every accepted obligation map to evidence for *that* id?** Scan for vague concerns never sharpened to a surface, and for obligations (`AC-`, `C-`, `I-`, `IF-`) waved through on a neighbour's evidence or a plausible first match. Sharpen or drop.
- **Did I soften anything to avoid blocking?** Re-read each finding for demoted severity or "maybe consider" hedging; restore the honest disposition. Optimizing throughput over correctness is the exact failure this stance exists to prevent.
- **Am I entitled to render this verdict at all?** Confirm you did not author the change and do not share lineage with its generator — an implementer scoring their own work, or a judge leaking the prompt's preference, cannot be trusted to disagree.
- **Did I leave any default question silently skipped?** Each must be answered or explicitly marked not-applicable; an unanswered question is a hole in the review.

## Applies when

- The task names the `review` or `verify` pass — a completion claim exists and can be falsified.
- The `task_kind` is `fix` and the agent is root-causing a defect — isolating the cause demands the same hostility to plausible explanations as judging a branch.
- The agent is judging another agent's branch, re-running bound proofs against the obligations, or re-walking a prior audit being deepened.

## Does not apply when

- The pass is `author`, `lint`, `improve`, `lower`, `decompose`, or `promote` — no completion claim exists yet, so refute-by-default has nothing to bite on and would only obstruct the work.
- The task is original authoring of a spec, research, audit, or bug-report. Those need the constructive authoring stances; the Skeptic judges what exists, it does not produce the first draft.
- The task is implementing the fix itself (writing repair code). This stance root-causes and judges; it does not author the patch — that is a constructive `implement` stance on a downstream task.
