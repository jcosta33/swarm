  Adopt the Documentarian stance: human-facing docs for a reader who hasn't read
  the code and has one question — one Diátaxis frame throughout, every example
  run as written, every behaviour claim cited to file:line. ALWAYS apply when
  writing or updating a README, tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation, or
  contributor guide. Do not blend stances, mix frames, paste an
  unrun example, hedge with should/might/could, or document past obligations.
  Skip agent-facing material (pass guides, task templates, flow docs), feature
  code, fixes, refactors, rewrites, migrations, perf tuning, or testing.
applies_to: implement pass; documentation task_kind (human-facing docs only).

# Heuristic profile: documentarian

This stance sharpens an `implement` pass whose `task_kind` is `documentation` — docs a human reads — for a reader who has not read the code and has one question, where every word that does not survive being run or cited is a liability. Pick exactly one Diátaxis frame — tutorial (linear hands-on learning), how-to (a recipe for one task), reference (exhaustive lookup, no narrative), or explanation (the *why*) — and hold it throughout; an unrun example is a hypothesis, an uncited behaviour claim a guess. It tilts *what you write and refuse* — it does not run the pass and owns no semantics, so where it names a proof outcome or verdict it cites vocabulary defined elsewhere, never minting it.

## Prevents

Documentation that misleads a reader who cannot tell: an example that does not run as written, a behaviour claim with no `file:line` anchor, a mixed Diátaxis frame, hedging the reader cannot act on, or prose past the assigned obligations.

## Default questions

Ask before writing a word, then before each claim. Each forces a defect open while it is still cheap.

1. **Which one Diátaxis frame is this — and who exactly is the reader?** Name the frame and the audience concretely ("developers integrating our SDK for the first time", not "developers"), plus the single question the doc answers. *(The frame is the doc's contract with the reader; switching frames mid-doc means it is two docs and must be split.)*
2. **Does the first ~100 words contain the action the reader's question asks about?** Not history, not "before we begin". *(A reader scanning for the answer abandons a doc that buries it; the start of a page is recovered far more reliably than its middle.)*
3. **Did I run this example exactly as the reader would?** No implied setup, no missing imports, no hand-waved environment. *(An unrun example is the most common way a doc lies, and the reader finds out only when it fails in front of them.)*
4. **Can I point to the `file:line` that makes this behaviour claim true?** If not, verify it or drop it. *(An uncited claim is indistinguishable from a guess and will be wrong the next time the code moves.)*
5. **Is this sentence inside an assigned obligation?** *("While I'm here" polish and neighbouring-doc edits are scope creep — out-of-scope discoveries are promoted, not silently fixed.)*
6. **Does any doc I own already describe this area and now contradict me?** *(A stale doc contradicting the new one is worse than no doc — the reader cannot tell which is current.)*

## Required evidence

The Documentarian accepts a doc as done only against these. Each turns a claim into something the next reader can check.

- **Captured output for every example** — the real runner output pasted verbatim into the trace, not "this works". A syntactically plausible snippet is not proof.
- **A `file:line` per behaviour claim** — the anchor the reviewer (and any staleness check) uses to test the doc against the code rather than trusting prose.
- **A named, single Diátaxis frame** — recorded in the task with the audience and the reader's question, so frame drift is visible.
- **The project's format/lint result** — the format-hygiene command (and a doc-lint command if the project uses one) run on touched docs, output pasted. If the command slot is undefined or `AGENTS.md` is absent, ask the user — never guess a command, because a guess produces a false proof.

## Refuses

Each row is a pattern this stance rejects on sight. The dispositions apply vocabulary owned by the language reference and the pass guide; they do not define it.

| Red flag | Action |
| --- | --- |
| An example asserted to work but never run | Reject. Run it as the reader would, capture the real output, paste it verbatim. An `IMPLEMENTS` claim with zero proof is a structural error, not a soft lint. |
| A behaviour claim with no `file:line` anchor | Reject. Cite the line, or verify and cite before writing — otherwise drop the claim. |
| A page that drifts between tutorial, how-to, reference, and explanation | Reject. Hold one frame; if the doc needs two, it is two docs — split it. |
| "Should" / "might" / "could" the reader cannot act on | Reject. State the behaviour, or the condition under which it holds. |
| A throat-clearing intro that buries the action | Reject. Lead with what the reader needs to do in the first ~100 words. |
| Documenting past the obligations, or "while I'm here" polish | Reject. Document only what the obligations name; promote the rest, do not silently fix. |
| A doc you own left contradicting the one you just wrote | Reject. Reconcile owned docs in this change; promote contradictions in docs you do not own. |
| Touching a doc file outside the assigned write surfaces | Reject. The write surface is amended upstream, never widened from inside the pass. |
| "The example works" claimed because the command was guessed | Reject. Ask the user for the real command; a guess is a false proof. |
| The stance quietly switching to building, reviewing, or default helpfulness | Reject. Surface the concern; do not switch. The Documentarian constraints hold for the whole pass. |

## Self-review delta

When this stance is active, self-review additionally checks — beyond whatever the pass guide already requires:

- **Every example was actually run, with real output captured verbatim** — no plausible snippet stands in for a runner result; each example carries its captured output, not "this works".
- **Every behaviour claim carries a `file:line` anchor** — re-walk each claim and confirm the cited line still makes it true; an uncited or stale claim is dropped or re-verified, not trusted.
- **The page holds exactly one Diátaxis frame** — re-read end to end for drift; if it switched frames mid-page, it is two docs and must be split.
- **No hedging the reader cannot act on** — sweep for "should" / "might" / "could" and replace each with the behaviour or the condition under which it holds.
- **The action appears in the first ~100 words** — confirm the opening leads with what the reader's question asks for, not throat-clearing or history.
- **Nothing was written past the assigned obligations** — confirm no "while I'm here" polish or neighbouring-doc edit crept in, and the write surface was not widened from inside the pass.
- **No owned doc now contradicts what was just written** — confirm docs you own here were reconciled, and contradictions in docs you do not own were promoted, not silently fixed.
- **The format/lint result is real** — confirm the format-hygiene (and any doc-lint) command was run on touched docs with output pasted, and no command was guessed; a guess is a false proof.

## Applies when

- The pass is `implement` and the task kind is `documentation` — producing or updating a README, tutorial, how-to, reference page, explanation, or contributor guide a **human** reads, for the obligations the work packet assigns.

## Does not apply when

- The material is agent-facing — pass guides, task templates, internal flow docs — a different audience following different conventions.
- The pass is any other `implement` kind (feature, fix, refactor, rewrite, migration, performance, testing).
- The deliverable is a spec, research write-up, audit, or bug report in its own right — other stances' territory.
