# Swarm Kernel Specification v0.1 — Part 07: Governance, memory, versioning

<!-- Part 07 of the Swarm Kernel Specification (§22–§25). All parts share one section numbering (§0–§35 + Appendices A–G); cross-references of the form “§N” resolve via the index in [README.md](./README.md). -->

## 22. Source authority

Source authority is the deterministic procedure a conformant Swarm repo MUST use to decide, when two artifacts assert conflicting obligations, **which obligation governs**. It is the conflict-resolution complement to the obligation graph (§3): the graph records *what* obligations exist and how they relate; source authority records *which wins* when they disagree. Authority is **not** a planning hint and **not** a confidence score; it is the binding precedence order, and it is the only sanctioned alternative to silently letting the most recently written artifact win.

The model has **two orthogonal axes** that MUST be applied **lexicographically — domain first, then artifact**. Rationale: a security obligation and a product obligation may share artifact rank yet must not share governing force; the two questions ("how authoritative is the *container*" and "how authoritative is the *domain*") are genuinely independent, so they MUST be ranked independently and combined in a fixed order rather than collapsed into one ladder.

*Supporting evidence (why authority-ranking rather than flat retrieval).* Treating every source as equally bindable is empirically costly for downstream generation: grounding on authoritative docs/API context improves code generation (CodeT5 +2.85pp pass@1, a ~52% relative gain [DOCPROMPTING]; up to +20% Pass@1 from targeted API/context retrieval [RACG]), whereas superficially-similar non-authoritative content *degrades* it by up to 15% [RACG], and repository-level context beats in-file context by over 10% [REPOCODER]. Source authority is the governance encoding of that finding — rank by provenance; do not treat every retrieved span as equally authoritative.

### 22.1 The two axes

#### 22.1.1 Axis A — artifact authority (backward trace)

Axis A ranks an obligation by **the kind of artifact that contains it** and that artifact's lifecycle status. It answers "how settled is the container this obligation was traced back *from*." It is therefore the **backward-trace** axis: follow an obligation back to its source artifact and read its rank.

| Rank | Artifact (with required status) | Notes |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ----- |
| 1 (highest) | accepted `adr.md` | Nygard-immutable decision (§30); the strongest recorded intent. |
| 2 | approved `spec.swarm.md` | The behavioral contract; `status: approved` in frontmatter. |
| 3 | accepted `finding.md` | A durable project fact whose `status` is `accepted` or `promoted` (§23). |
| 4 | reviewed `audit.md` | Present-state observation that has passed a `review` pass. |
| 5 | reviewed `research.md` | External/exploratory evidence that has passed a `review` pass. |
| 6 | task notes (`task.md`) | Execution-local; durable only after promotion (§23.4). |
| 7 (lowest) | chat | Conversational context; never authoritative on its own. |

A conformant tool MUST reject (lint `SOL-M004` authority-conflict, see §22.3) any claim that a lower-ranked artifact silently amended a higher-ranked one (an irreconcilable *equal-rank* conflict is the distinct `SOL-M002`, §22.2 step 3). An artifact below `approved`/`accepted` status occupies the rank of its **draft tier**, which is one step below its accepted tier; e.g. a `proposed` ADR does not outrank an `approved` spec.

#### 22.1.2 Axis B — domain authority (forward governing force)

Axis B ranks an obligation by **the governance domain it belongs to**, independent of where it is written. It answers "how much *forward* governing force this obligation projects over everything downstream." It is therefore the **forward-governing-force** axis.

| Rank | Domain | Examples |
| ---- | ------ | -------- |
| 1 (highest) | enforced-policy | Deterministic, externally-enforced rules (the enforcement lane, §17): write-surface gates, secret redaction, permission denies. |
| 2 | compliance | Regulatory / legal obligations (data residency, retention, audit trails). |
| 3 | security | Authn/authz, secret handling, attack-surface constraints. |
| 4 | architecture | Module boundaries, ownership, layering, public interfaces. |
| 5 | product | User-visible behavior, acceptance criteria. |
| 6 | team | Conventions, style, process agreements. |
| 7 | task-map | Per-task execution scoping (§19). |
| 8 (lowest) | memory | Promoted findings/patterns (§23). |

An obligation's domain MUST be discoverable **deterministically**: a `spec.swarm.md` MAY declare a default `domain:` in its frontmatter (§5.8), and any obligation block MAY carry a per-obligation `DOMAIN <name>` metadata clause (§5) that overrides the spec default. The `lower` pass populates the IR `node.authority` (§12.4.1) by this precedence: the obligation's own `DOMAIN` clause if present, else the spec frontmatter `domain`, else the default `product`. The eight legal domain names are the Axis-B ranks above (`enforced-policy` … `memory`); the two lowest, `task-map` and `memory`, are also the two axis **floors** (§22.4).

### 22.2 The conflict rule (normative)

When two obligations conflict (they constrain the same trigger/state/surface with incompatible modality), a conformant tool MUST resolve them by this exact procedure, in order:

1. **Compare DOMAIN rank (Axis B) first — but only when at least one obligation is in the hard-policy band (Axis-B ranks 1–3: enforced-policy, compliance, security).** When a hard-policy-band obligation is involved, the higher domain wins **regardless of artifact rank** (a `security` obligation governs a `product` obligation even from a lower-ranked artifact). If **neither** obligation is in the hard-policy band, domain rank does **not** override artifact authority — go to step 2. The in-band obligation exercises domain-dominance only when it lives in a **durable, reviewed artifact** (Axis-A rank ≤ 5 — an accepted ADR, approved spec, accepted finding, or reviewed audit/research); a hard-policy claim living only in un-promoted task notes or chat (Axis-A ranks 6–7) MUST first be promoted to a durable artifact before it can govern — an un-reviewed note cannot override an accepted ADR.
2. **Otherwise — neither obligation is in the hard-policy band, or the two are in the same domain — compare ARTIFACT authority (Axis A).** The obligation in the higher-ranked artifact wins; if artifact rank also ties, the higher domain rank breaks the tie.
3. **If both axes are equal, STOP.** A conformant tool MUST NOT auto-select a winner. It MUST emit `SOL-M002` (semantic-layer contradiction, §8) and route the conflict to amendment/review (§14). Resolution is an authoring act, never an inference.

This ordering is **lexicographic with a hard-policy gate**: domain rank is decisive only inside the hard-policy band (Axis-B ranks 1–3); below that band, artifact authority is the most-significant key and domain rank is only a tie-breaker. This prevents a low-criticality domain note (e.g. a `team`-rank remark in a reviewed audit) from overriding a higher-authority artifact (e.g. a `product` obligation in an approved spec).

### 22.3 Worked tie-break example

> A reviewed `audit.md` records a `security` obligation: *the refresh endpoint MUST reject reuse of a rotated refresh token*. An approved `spec.swarm.md` records a `product` obligation: *the refresh endpoint MUST accept the most recent token presented, for a seamless re-login*. They conflict on the same trigger (reuse of a prior refresh token).

Applying §22.2:

1. **Axis B (domain).** `security` (rank 3) vs `product` (rank 5). Security outranks product. **Resolution stops here: the security obligation governs.**
2. Axis A is **never consulted**, even though the product obligation sits in a higher-ranked artifact (approved spec, rank 2) than the security obligation (reviewed audit, rank 4).

```sol
CONSTRAINT C-014: # from reviewed audit.md, domain: security
THE refresh endpoint MUST NOT accept a refresh token that has already been rotated
VERIFY BY security:cmdScan:auth-replay#rotated-token
AFFECTS auth.refresh
```

```sol
REQ AC-031: # from approved spec.swarm.md, domain: product
WHEN a client presents the most recent refresh token
THE refresh endpoint MUST issue a new access token
VERIFY BY test:cmdTest:auth-refresh#happy-path
AFFECTS auth.refresh
```

`C-014` (security) governs. The product REQ `AC-031` is not deleted; it is routed to amendment so its trigger can be narrowed to exclude rotated tokens. Had both obligations been `product`, the procedure would fall to Axis A and the approved spec would win over the reviewed audit.

> **Second example (below the hard-policy band).** A reviewed `audit.md` records a `team`-domain note: *new modules SHOULD live under `src/v2/`*. An approved `spec.swarm.md` records a `product` obligation on the same surface. Neither is in the hard-policy band (ranks 1–3), so domain rank does **not** decide; ARTIFACT authority does (step 2), and the approved spec (rank 2) outranks the reviewed audit (rank 4). The product obligation wins; the audit note is advisory. Were the audit note instead a `security` obligation (in-band), step 1 would flip the result.

### 22.4 Invariants on both axes

These hold on Axis A and Axis B simultaneously, and a conformant tool MUST NOT let any precedence computation violate them:

| Invariant | Statement |
| --------- | --------- |
| Code is reality, not intent | Code and tests are implementation reality. They MAY **falsify** an obligation (producing `FAIL`/`CONTRADICTED`/`STALE`, §14, §16) but MUST NOT **silently amend** intent. A divergence routes to the §16 three-way reconcile, never to a quiet edit of the obligation. |
| Memory and task-map are a floor | `memory` (Axis B rank 8) and `task-map` (rank 7) are the lowest domains and never outrank any governing domain; equivalently, a promoted finding or a task scoping note can **inform** but never **weaken** an obligation. A promotion that would weaken an obligation *as memory* is itself a `SOL-M002` contradiction (§23). Promotion to a spec is a **domain-promotion**, not memory overriding intent: a finding *qua memory* never outranks an obligation, but once it is re-stated as a spec obligation via the `author` pass (§23.4.2) it carries its **new container's** authority — that is intent acquiring rank, not the `memory` floor being breached. |
| Planning hints reorder, never weaken | `DEPENDS ON`, `parallel_group`, and other planning metadata (§13, §18) change the **order** work runs in. They MUST NOT change modality, scope, or verification bindings of any obligation. |

### 22.5 Bidirectional traceability framing

The two axes are the two directions of requirements traceability:

- **Axis A is the backward trace.** Given an obligation, you trace it *back* to the artifact it came from; the artifact's rank tells you how settled the provenance is.
- **Axis B is the forward governing force.** Given an obligation, you trace its domain *forward* over everything it governs; the domain's rank tells you how much force it projects downstream.

A conformant repo's source-authority reference (`docs/model/source-authority.md`, a kernel-required reference per §20) MUST state both axes, the lexicographic rule, the three invariants, and at least the §22.3 worked tie-break.

---

### 22.6 Human-approval-required changes

Source authority (§22) decides which obligation governs when two conflict; this section decides which **edits** to the obligation set a conformant repo MAY apply on its own versus which require approval. The classification feeding this table is the closed twelve-category semantic diff of §10.4: categories 1–11 are amendments and require approval; category 12 (pure normalization) does not.

| Change type | Approval required |
| --- | --- |
| Add, remove, or renumber an obligation id (`AC-NNN`/`C-NNN`/`I-NNN`/`IF-NNN`) | Yes |
| Change an obligation's actor, trigger, modality, response, or non-goal | Yes |
| Make a breaking `INTERFACE` (`IF-NNN`) change | Yes |
| Materially resolve a `[blocking]` `QUESTION` (§6, §11.1.2) | Yes |
| Accept a `manual` proof where no automated proof previously existed (§15) | Yes |
| Approve or supersede an `adr.md` (§30) | Yes |
| Promote a `finding.md` into an approved `spec.swarm.md` (§23) | Yes |
| Normalize formatting, casing, or keyword form (§4.10) | No |
| Fix an editorial typo with no semantic effect | No |
| Add a missing link, or complete a reference to an **already-declared** proof, without changing meaning | No (normalization, §10.4 cat 12) |
| Add, remove, or repoint a `VERIFY BY` proof binding | Yes — amendment (§10.4 cat 7) |
| Compress redundant prose while preserving semantics | No |

The "Yes" rows are exactly the changes that alter what the system is obligated to build, what counts as proof, or which decision governs — each one corresponds to a non-normalization category in §10.4 and MUST route to amendment/review (§14) rather than being applied inside `improve` (§10.1). The "No" rows are the pure-normalization class (§10.4, category 12): they are semantics-preserving by definition and a conformant tool MAY apply them without approval.

> **R-APPROVAL-AUTHORITY.** This spec is provider- and org-neutral about **who** approves; it defines only **what** requires approval. Approval **authority** for any "Yes" row MUST be resolved through the source-authority ladder (§22): the approver is the owner of the highest-ranked governing artifact in the relevant domain — the accepted `adr.md` owner for an ADR change, the approved `spec.swarm.md` owner for an obligation or interface change, the domain owner (Axis B, §22.1.2) for a cross-domain conflict. There is **no** undefined "human role" in the kernel; "approval required: Yes" means "an authoring act by the relevant source-authority owner is required," never an appeal to an unspecified gatekeeper. A change applied without the authority resolved by §22 is itself a `SOL-M002` contradiction (a lower-ranked actor silently amending a higher-ranked artifact, §22.1.1).


### 22.7 Risk-based human oversight (HITL escalation)

The `RISK <low|medium|high|critical>` clause (§4.3, §6.8) is, in the rest of the kernel, **inert**: it lowers to a `risk` scalar in the IR (§12) and feeds nothing — no gate, no verdict requirement, no escalation. This subsection wires it to a normative obligation. The wiring is motivated, not decorative: agents are unreliable at knowing **when to stop and ask a human**. On messy or ambiguous specs the best measured agent solves only **~24%** of tasks *even when handed an explicit tool to escalate*, and selective escalation (the `Ask-F1` metric) is the measured weak point [HILBENCH]; independently, prompt-injection and irreversible-action risk is the **top-ranked** LLM security concern [OWASP-LLM01]. A risk tier that triggers nothing is therefore the exact failure the field was meant to prevent — high-stakes work proceeding on agent self-assessment alone. As elsewhere in Swarm this is NO-RUNTIME: the rule below is a **contract** (a lint + a verdict-field requirement) that is manual-today (§26) and that future tooling builds against; nothing here ships an escalation engine.

#### 22.7.1 The high-oversight band

An obligation is in the **high-oversight band** iff **either** of these holds:

| Trigger | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| Declared critical risk | The obligation carries `RISK critical` (§6.8). |
| Irreversible / shared write surface | Any surface in the obligation's `WRITES` set is tagged `integration` or `shared` (§18.3.1). *(Irreversible actions — migrations, destructive or non-replayable operations — MUST be modelled with an `integration` surface tag or `RISK critical` so band membership stays machine-checkable; "irreversibility" is not itself a checkable predicate.)* |

The two `WRITES`-attribute triggers are deliberately reused from the safe-parallelism predicate: `integration` and `shared` are already the surfaces the kernel treats as high-conflict and serializes through a single dedicated step (§18.3.1, §18.4), so they are the same surfaces whose blast radius is hardest to undo. `RISK high`, `RISK medium`, and `RISK low` are **not** in the band on the strength of the tier alone (a `high`-risk obligation that writes only an ordinary exclusive feature surface is out of band) — but any obligation, at any tier, enters the band the moment its `WRITES` touches an `integration`/`shared` surface, or it carries `RISK critical`.

#### 22.7.2 Normative rule

For an obligation in the high-oversight band (§22.7.1), a conformant repo MUST satisfy **both** of the following:

1. **Named-human REVIEW binding.** The obligation MUST carry a `manual @ REVIEW` proof binding (`VERIFY BY manual:…`, §15) in addition to whatever executable proofs its task-kind default suite requires (§15.8). This makes a recorded human judgment a *required* verdict for the obligation, not an optional one — the band's work cannot reach the merge gate on executable proofs alone.
2. **Named human on the verdict and on any waiver.** That `manual` verdict MUST name its human **authority** (the same `authority` discipline a `WAIVED` verdict carries, §14.3, §17.3); and any `WAIVED` verdict on a band obligation MUST be issued by a **human or the spec owner**, never self-issued by a skill, persona, or the implementing agent (§17.3). An in-band `manual` verdict or waiver lacking a named human authority is a `SOL-V010` diagnostic (below).

Lower risk tiers **MAY** be agent-verified: an out-of-band obligation (`RISK low|medium|high` with no irreversible/`integration`/`shared` write) is governed by its ordinary task-kind default suite (§15.8) and MAY be discharged entirely by executable proofs and an agent-recorded `manual` verdict where its suite calls for one. The rule raises the floor only for the band; it does not put a human in the loop of every obligation, which would re-create the over-serialization the `RISK` tiers exist to avoid.

| Risk / surface | REVIEW binding | Verdict / waiver authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RISK critical` (any surface) | `manual @ REVIEW` REQUIRED | Named human (verdict + any waiver) |
| Any tier, `WRITES` an `integration`/`shared`/irreversible surface | `manual @ REVIEW` REQUIRED | Named human (verdict + any waiver) |
| `RISK low|medium|high`, ordinary exclusive `WRITES` | Per task-kind default suite (§15.8) | MAY be agent-verified |

#### 22.7.3 Authority and waiver are the §22.6 / §17.3 authority, not a new role

The "named human" here is **not** a new kernel role. *Who* the human is stays unspecified and is bound locally by the adopting repository, per the §0.6 approval-role assumption — the kernel fixes **what** the band requires (a `manual @ REVIEW` plus a named authority), never the identity, title, or headcount of the approver. Concretely:

- A band obligation's `manual @ REVIEW` verdict is exactly the §22.6 row **"Accept a `manual` proof where no automated proof previously existed"** when it stands in for an automated proof — an approval-required (`Yes`) change whose **authority is resolved through the source-authority ladder** (§22.6, `R-APPROVAL-AUTHORITY`): the approver is the owner of the highest-ranked governing artifact in the relevant domain (Axis A / Axis B, §22.1).
- A **waiver** on a band obligation is the §17.3 `WAIVER` lifecycle unchanged: authority is a **human or the spec owner**, with mandatory `authority + reason + expiry` and auto-expiry on source-hash change (§17.3). There are no permanent waivers and no agent-self-issued waivers in the band.

A band obligation whose `manual`/`WAIVED` verdict names no human authority is a `SOL-V010` diagnostic (a high-oversight obligation discharged without named human authority), placed in the `SOL-V` verification-binding layer (`SOL-<LAYER>NNN`, layer `V`) alongside `SOL-V001` (missing verification path) and `SOL-V005` (missing mandatory verdict fields). Like every `SOL-V` code today it is enforced by hand or by the documented `lint-spec` pass guide (§26), aspirational/manual until tooling exists (Principle 1, §2). A change that records an agent-only verdict on a band obligation, or that lets a skill self-issue a band waiver, is additionally a `SOL-M002` contradiction by the §22.6 rule — a lower-ranked actor (the agent) silently amending what only a named source-authority owner may approve (§22.1.1).

> Worked example — a migration obligation. `CONSTRAINT C-022` carries `WRITES db.migrations` (a `SURFACE … [integration]`, §18.3.1) and `RISK high`. Both band triggers fire: the `integration` surface alone would suffice, and so the tier `high` (out of band on tier alone) is moot. `C-022` MUST therefore bind `manual @ REVIEW` in addition to its `migration` default suite (`test @ VERIFY`, `static @ VERIFY`, `contract @ VERIFY`, §15.8); its `manual` verdict MUST name the human authority who reviewed the migration; and any `WAIVED` on it MUST be issued by that human or the spec owner with `reason + expiry` (§17.3). An agent-recorded `PASS` on `C-022` with no named human authority does not reach the merge gate — it is `SOL-V010`.

The conformant repo's source-authority reference (`docs/model/source-authority.md`, §20) MUST state the high-oversight band, the §22.7.2 two-part rule, and the tie to §17.3 waiver authority and the §22.6 approval table.

## 23. The memory model

Memory is Swarm's durable feedback loop: the mechanism by which a discovery made during one task becomes reliably available to a future task without bloating the always-loaded bootloader (§31). The model is **two-tier and provenance-anchored**. It is markdown-only (Principle 1, §2): nothing here describes a retrieval engine; it describes the *files and the discipline* a future retrieval tool would build against.

Rationale: chat transcripts and inline prose are not memory — they are unindexed, unprovenanced, and unfalsifiable. Memory MUST be a **promotion system** (a fact earns durability through a recorded promotion) backed by an **immutable evidence store**, with a compact index over it.

### 23.1 Tier-1 — the compact map (kernel)

Tier-1 is what an agent reads *first* and *cheaply*. It is a map, not the territory.

#### 23.1.1 `memory/INDEX.md`

`memory/INDEX.md` is a kernel-required core artifact (§20). It is a **compact map of links, not explanations**. Each entry MUST carry a **`Load when` condition** — the trigger that tells a future agent the entry is relevant to its current task.

Normative rule (the **load-when discipline**): if an entry cannot name *when it matters*, it MUST be removed from the index. An entry without a usable `Load when` is dead weight against the §24 loss budget and the §31 density cap.

```text
## Durable findings

| Finding | Status | Load when |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| finding-refresh-token-replay.md | promoted | Touching auth token rotation or refresh endpoints |
| finding-bq-cost-explosion.md | accepted | Writing or reviewing analytics queries against BigQuery |

## Topic files

| Topic | File | Load when |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Architecture patterns | `patterns/architecture.md` | Editing module boundaries, ownership, or cross-cutting flows |
```

The INDEX **links into** Tier-2 artifacts; it MUST NOT duplicate their bodies. A conformant tool MAY treat a divergence between an INDEX summary line and the linked artifact as advisory drift.

#### 23.1.2 `memory/glossary.md`

`memory/glossary.md` enforces **one word, one meaning** (ASD-STE100 controlled-vocabulary discipline `[STE]`, also referenced by APS §7 and the `SOL-P006` undefined-term rule, §8). Each entry binds exactly one term to exactly one definition. A term whose meaning is contested MUST be split into distinct terms, never overloaded. The glossary is the project-level fallback for term resolution; an in-file `TERM` definition in a `spec.swarm.md` takes precedence over the glossary for that spec (term-resolution precedence).

### 23.2 Tier-2 — the immutable evidence store (kernel)

Tier-2 is the **territory**: the durable artifacts the INDEX points at.

| Artifact | Role in memory | Mutability |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| `finding.md` | One durable project fact + its evidence | Immutable once `accepted`/`promoted`; status may advance, body does not silently change |
| `adr.md` | Architectural/product decision + rationale | Nygard-immutable (§30); amend only by superseding ADR |
| `audit.md` | Present-state risk/debt observation | Immutable record of an observation at a point in time |
| `bug-report.md` | Reproducible-defect diagnosis | Immutable record of a reproduction |
| `memory/patterns/*.md` | Recurring knowledge spanning **multiple** findings | Append-on-supersession |

`memory/patterns/*.md` exists for knowledge that recurs across more than one finding — a pattern is the distillation of several findings into reusable guidance, and it MUST cite the findings it generalizes. A single finding MUST NOT be promoted directly to a pattern; promote it to a `finding.md` first, and to a pattern only once a second corroborating finding exists.

### 23.3 Provenance (mandatory on every promoted finding)

Every finding that reaches `accepted` or `promoted` status MUST carry the full provenance record. Provenance is what makes a finding *falsifiable* and *staleness-checkable*; a finding without it is chat, not memory.

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `claim` | The one durable fact, stated as a single proposition. |
| `evidence` | The file/command/output/source that grounds the claim. |
| `origin_obligations[]` | The obligation IDs (`AC-/C-/I-…`) the finding was discovered against. |
| `origin_traces[]` | The `*.swarm.trace.md` entries that produced the evidence. |
| `pass+profile` | The pass and heuristic profile under which it was found (e.g. `review[profile: skeptic]`, §26–§27). |
| `reviewer_or_tool` | The human reviewer or tool/adapter that confirmed it. |
| `timestamp` | When it was promoted. |
| `content_hash` | Hash of the cited source/surfaces at promotion time (drives staleness, §23.5). |
| `confidence` | `high` \| `medium` \| `low`. |
| `applies-when` / `does-not-apply-when` | The scope envelope; mirrors the `Load when` of the INDEX entry. |

```

### 23.4 Promotion

A discovery during a task does not become memory by being written down; it becomes memory by being **promoted**. The kernel references the promotion protocol (`docs/language/promotion-protocol.md`, §20) and its status enum. Every promotion item raised during a task MUST resolve to one of these before the task closes:

| Promotion status | Meaning |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| `pending` | Raised, not yet dispositioned. |
| `promoted` | Written to its durable target and indexed. |
| `deferred` | Recorded for a future task with reason. |
| `rejected` | Judged non-durable with reason. |
| `blocked` | Cannot promote yet (e.g. needs an ADR) with reason. |

Normative rule: a task MUST NOT close while any promotion item is `pending`. A `promoted` finding MUST appear in `memory/INDEX.md` with a `Load when` condition (§23.1.1) and carry full provenance (§23.3). A promotion that would *weaken* an obligation is forbidden — it is a `SOL-M002` contradiction routed to amendment, because `memory` is the floor domain on Axis B (§22.4).

#### 23.4.1 G9 tie-break — "universal workflow rule" promotions

The promotion table (§23.4, adapted from this specification) routes a *universal workflow rule* toward `AGENTS.md`. This collides with the ≤200-line bootloader cap and ADR 0017 (only persistent **facts** belong in `AGENTS.md`; **procedures** belong in pass guides). The kernel resolves the collision normatively (G9):

A "universal workflow rule" promotion MUST become **a pass-guide edit (the procedure) PLUS at most a one-line `AGENTS.md` pointer (the fact that the guide exists and when to load it).** It MUST NOT inline the procedure into `AGENTS.md`.

| Where it goes | What goes there |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Pass guide (`docs/skills/…`, §26) | The actual procedure / steps. |
| `AGENTS.md` | One line: the pointer + its load-when, nothing procedural. |

> Example — promoting "always run the migration dry-run before applying": the dry-run procedure is added to the `implement` pass guide; `AGENTS.md` gains only `- Before applying a migration, load the implement pass guide (migration section).`

This keeps the bootloader a map (consistent with §31) and the procedure lazily loaded.

#### 23.4.2 Discovery-to-promotion-target table

Promotion is **mandatory before task closure** (§23.4): every discovery a task surfaces enters the **promotion queue** and MUST resolve to one of `pending | promoted | deferred | rejected | blocked`, and a task MUST NOT close while any item is `pending` — all five statuses except `pending` are terminal-for-this-task, and `deferred`/`rejected`/`blocked` each carry a reason. This subsection is the consolidated routing table the §20.3.2 promotion-protocol reference doc cites: given the *kind* of discovery, it fixes the single durable target the `promote` pass (§9) writes to. The kinds are mutually exclusive by intent; when a discovery has two faces (e.g. it is both a durable decision and a reusable pattern), it is promoted to each applicable target and each lands as its own queue item.

| Discovery | Promote to |
| --------- | ---------- |
| New intended behaviour (a real obligation/constraint to build against) | `spec.swarm.md` (a new or amended `REQ`/`CONSTRAINT`/`INVARIANT`/`INTERFACE`), or an ADR when the behaviour is gated on an undecided architectural/product choice. |
| Durable architectural or product decision (a choice with consequences, alternatives, trade-offs) | An ADR (`.swarm/sources/adrs/<nnnn>-<slug>.md`). |
| Present-state risk or debt (what *is*, observed but not yet a chosen change) | An audit (`.swarm/sources/audits/<slug>.md`) — observation-only, never prescriptive (§20.3.3). |
| Reproduced defect evidence (root cause + expected vs actual, reproducible) | A bug-report (`.swarm/sources/bugs/<slug>.md`) — diagnosis-only; the fix promotes onward to a `task_kind: fix` task (§20.3.3). |
| Reusable project fact (a durable claim learned during work, with evidence) | A finding (`.swarm/sources/findings/<slug>.md`), indexed in `memory/INDEX.md` with a `Load when` (§23.1.1) and full provenance (§23.3). |
| Repeated cross-task pattern (a recurring solution shape seen across more than one task) | `memory/patterns/*.md`. |
| Terminology clarification (a term whose meaning was ambiguous or drifted) | `memory/glossary.md` (the canonical lexicon; resolves `SOL-V`-layer terminology drift at the source). |
| Universal workflow rule (a procedure that should apply to every future task) | A pass-guide edit (the procedure) **plus at most a one-line `AGENTS.md` pointer** — NEVER inline procedure in `AGENTS.md`; the bootloader holds persistent facts, not steps (§23.4.1). |
| Purely local execution detail (relevant only to this task's run) | Keep in the task only (`task.md`); it is **not** durable and is dispositioned `rejected` for promotion with reason "execution-local". |

Two normative consequences hold across every row. First, a promotion that would *weaken* an existing obligation is forbidden at any target — it is a `SOL-M002` contradiction routed to amendment, because `memory` is the floor domain on Axis B (§22.4). Second, "keep in the task only" is a real disposition, not an omission: such an item is still recorded in the queue and resolved (`rejected`, with reason), so that the mandatory-before-close rule (§23.4) admits no silent drops.


#### 23.4.3 Validation and rollback (memory governance)

Authorization is not validation. Governance research argues a memory write MUST pass consistency verification — not merely owner approval — before consolidation, and names three failure points: poisoning at ingestion, semantic drift at consolidation, and conflict/hallucination at retrieval `[SSGM]` (conceptual framework). The v0.1 model of §23.4 (`pending → promoted` on approval) is forward-only and addresses none of these. Two additions close the gap:

- **The `validated` status.** A high-consequence promotion MUST pass `pending → validated → promoted`, where `validated` requires **independent corroboration** — a second finding, a re-run proof, or a reviewer who is not the promoting agent — generalizing the §23.2 two-finding rule for patterns. A `pending` finding produced by an externally-authored source (the §17.5.2 untrusted-source boundary; the `[NVIDIA-AGENTSMD]` / `[RULESBACKDOOR]` poisoning vector) MUST NOT skip `validated`.
- **Rollback.** Promotion gains a `rolled-back` disposition: a promoted finding later shown poisoned, `CONTRADICTED` (§14), or `STALE` (§16) MUST be withdrawable, recording a **retraction entry in `memory/INDEX.md`** (not a silent delete — the chain stays auditable, per Nygard immutability, §30) and re-opening any obligation it had narrowed (§22.4, §23.4.2). Supersession replaces a fact with a better one; rollback withdraws a fact that should never have been promoted.

The two-tier index/store model of §23.1 is consistent with the agent-memory literature — OS-style two-tier context management `[MEMGPT]`, extract–consolidate–retrieve pipelines `[MEM0]`, self-linking agentic notes `[AMEM]`, and tiered episodic→semantic consolidation `[MEMTIER]` (tripartite, not two-tier) — cited as design lineage, not as validation of any Swarm-specific number. Automated validation scoring, decay, and embedding retrieval remain deferred (§23.6, §35.2).

### 23.5 Staleness

A finding's `status` enum is `candidate | accepted | promoted | rejected | stale | superseded`. A finding becomes **`stale`** when its `content_hash` (§23.3) no longer matches the cited source/surfaces — the same drift signal that produces the `STALE` verdict lifecycle decorator (§14) and the spec↔code drift reconcile (§16). A `stale` finding MUST NOT be relied on as authority; it is routed to re-verification or supersession. A `superseded` finding records its replacement in `memory/INDEX.md`'s stale/superseded table.

The kernel ships the **fields** that make staleness computable (`content_hash`, `origin_traces`); it does **not** ship the comparator. Recomputing the hash and flipping `accepted → stale` is a harness/CLI concern (§16, §17), aspirational/manual today (Principle 1).

### 23.6 Deferred to post-v0.1

The following are explicitly **out of scope for v0.1**, because each requires a runtime Swarm does not ship:

| Deferred | Reason |
| -------- | ------ |
| Embedding / dense-vector retrieval | Needs an index engine and runtime. |
| LRU (or any automatic) eviction | Needs a runtime memory manager. |
| Automatic staleness hashing | Needs a differ/checker (§16); fields shipped, comparator deferred. |
| Cross-session agent identity | Needs persistent runtime state. |
| Memory dashboards / analytics | Needs a runtime UI. |

v0.1 ships the two-tier file model, the provenance fields, the promotion statuses, and the `Load when` discipline. Automation builds against them later.

### 23.7 The ledger (compact reconciled history)

Memory (§23.1–§23.6) preserves *durable facts*; the **ledger** preserves *compact reconciled history* — the audit trail of completed work after its execution material has been thrown away. The two are complementary, not redundant: a `finding.md` records *what we learned* and is loaded *when its `Load when` fires*; a ledger entry records *what a task did, covered, and proved* and is read *when an auditor reconstructs why the codebase is the way it is*. This subsection is **design rationale**, not an empirical claim — it specifies the files and the append-only discipline a future reconciliation tool builds against (Principle 1, §2, NO-RUNTIME); nothing here ships a reconciliation engine, a compactor, or a git driver.

**Motivation.** Swarm MUST NOT preserve every task scratchpad forever. A task surfaces a `task.md` frame, one or more `trace.md` implementation claims, and a `review.md` verdict record — all under `generated/` (§23.7.2). Once the work is merged or abandoned and its discoveries are promoted (§23.4), those execution packets have served their purpose; keeping them indefinitely re-creates exactly the unindexed accumulation that §23's rationale rejects for chat transcripts. The ledger is the bright line: traces and reviews are **compacted into** a ledger entry on reconciliation, and the verbose packets MAY then be removed. (This is design layer 9 — Principle 9 of the workspace doctrine: *the ledger preserves compact history* — wired to the kernel's already-defined verdict, provenance, and promotion machinery.)

#### 23.7.1 Location and shape

The ledger lives in the canonical Swarm workspace at:

```text
.swarm/ledger/
  changes/          # one entry per completed change set (covered obligations, surfaces, proofs, verdicts)
  merges/           # one entry per merge-gate decision (§14.4) at the change-set level
  promotions/       # one entry per resolved promotion queue (§23.4)
```

A **ledger entry is an immutable, append-only record** under the same discipline as an ADR (§30.1, Nygard): an entry is never edited in place; a correction is a *new* entry that references the one it amends, so the truth of any change is the full chain, not the latest row. The ledger is therefore the change-history analogue of the ADR chain — ADRs record *decisions* immutably; the ledger records *reconciled task outcomes* immutably. This append-only-with-supersession shape mirrors the catalogue and ADR conventions already normative elsewhere in the kernel (§8.1.1, §30.1) and is a design choice, not a measured property.

#### 23.7.2 What is ephemeral vs. what is durable

The ledger fixes the durability boundary across the three workspace knowledge layers:

| Layer | Path | Durability | Git disposition |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Execution packets | `.swarm/generated/{tasks,traces,reviews}/` | **Ephemeral** — recreatable from sources; compacted into the ledger on reconciliation | MAY be gitignored (`.swarm/generated/tasks/` and, optionally, `traces/`/`reviews/` once governance accepts ledger compaction as the system of record) |
| Ledger | `.swarm/ledger/{changes,merges,promotions}/` | **Durable** — the compact audit trail that outlives the packets | Committed |
| Memory + sources | `.swarm/memory/`, `.swarm/sources/` | **Durable** — recall + desired truth | Committed |

`generated/` is, by definition, generated or derived material (§23.4.2 routes a *purely local execution detail* to "keep in the task only," i.e. it dies with the task). Because the ledger captures the load-bearing summary of a trace/review on reconciliation, a project MAY gitignore the verbose `generated/` packets without losing auditability — the ledger is what survives. By contrast, `ledger/`, `memory/`, and `sources/` are never gitignored as a matter of governance: deleting them deletes the project's reconciled history, durable recall, and desired truth respectively. (Whether a given repo gitignores active `traces/`/`reviews/` is a per-project governance choice, not a kernel mandate; the kernel mandate is only that *if* they are dropped, their load-bearing content MUST first have compacted into a ledger entry.)

#### 23.7.3 What a ledger entry records (per completed task)

A `changes/` ledger entry is the compaction target of a task's trace + review. It MUST capture, for the completed task:

| Field | Content | Source it compacts |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------ |
| Covered obligation IDs | The `AC-`/`C-`/`I-`/`IF-` IDs the task discharged | The trace's `IMPLEMENTS`/`PRESERVES` claims (§21.4) and the review's verdict matrix (§21.5) |
| Changed write-surfaces + hashes | Each surface in the task's `WRITES` set with its `per_surface_hash` | The **one trace-provenance schema** (§16.1): the `per_surface_hash[]` and `source_hash` recorded on each binding's last `PASS` — the ledger pins the same hashes, so the change record and the drift/staleness join (§16) never diverge |
| Proofs run + their verdicts | Each `VERIFY BY` binding's recorded verdict, in the **4-core + 3-lifecycle** model (§14.1): core ∈ {PASS, FAIL, BLOCKED, UNVERIFIED}, lifecycle ∈ {WAIVED, STALE, CONTRADICTED} | The review's per-obligation `VERDICT` blocks and obligation-verdict matrix (§14, §21.5) |
| Promotion results | The disposition of every promotion-queue item — `promoted` / `deferred` / `rejected` / `blocked` (and `validated`/`rolled-back` where §23.4.3 applied) | The resolved promotion queue (§23.4); a task cannot close while any item is `pending`, so the ledger entry records a fully-resolved queue by construction |

A `merges/` entry records the **merge-gate decision** itself: the change-set-level `PASS`/`BLOCKED` verdict under the §14.4 gate (promotable iff every required obligation's latest verdict is `PASS`/`WAIVED` and none is `STALE`/`CONTRADICTED`/`FAIL`/`BLOCKED`/`UNVERIFIED`), together with the **unauthorized-change list** the review computed (`## Unauthorized changes`, §21.5.1 — every diff hunk not traceable to an authorizing obligation, judged `allowed`/`suspect`/`reject`). The merge-gate decision and the unauthorized-change list are precisely what make the ledger an **audit trail**: they record *that the gate was evaluated, with what result, and what fell outside authorized scope* — the falsifiable record that the change set was admitted by the gate rather than waved through. A `promotions/` entry records the durable targets each promoted discovery landed at (§23.4.2: spec amendment, ADR, finding, pattern, glossary, pass-guide-plus-pointer), closing the loop between a task's discoveries and `memory/` + `sources/`.

Because every field above is **compacted from artifacts the kernel already specifies** — the trace-provenance schema (§16.1, G11), the verdict model (§14), the review's unauthorized-change and final-verdict sections (§21.5), and the promotion queue (§23.4) — the ledger introduces no new evidence type and no new empirical claim. It is a projection of the existing reconciliation outputs into a compact, immutable, committed history, so that `generated/` may be discarded without severing the backward trace (§22.5) from today's code to the obligations, proofs, and verdicts that produced it.

#### 23.7.4 Cross-references

The ledger is defined entirely by reference to existing kernel machinery: the merge gate and the 4-core+3-lifecycle verdict it records (§14); the single trace-provenance schema whose `source_hash`/`per_surface_hash[]` it pins so its change record stays joinable to drift/staleness (§16); the promotion queue and dispositions whose resolved state it captures (§23.4); and the Nygard append-only immutability discipline it inherits for its own entries (§30). A conformant repo's workspace reference (the doc that states the `.swarm/` layout and the §23.7.2 ephemeral-vs-durable boundary) MUST state that `generated/` traces/reviews compact INTO `.swarm/ledger/` on reconciliation and MAY then be gitignored, while `.swarm/ledger/`, `.swarm/memory/`, and `.swarm/sources/` are durable and committed.

## 24. The distillation loss budget

Distillation is the deliberate **dropping of detail** that happens whenever information crosses a boundary in the pipeline — most acutely at the **spec → task lowering boundary** (§11) and the **promotion boundary** (§23.4). The loss budget is the discipline governing *what may be dropped* versus *what must survive*. Its purpose is to let lowering and promotion compress aggressively without ever silently losing binding force.

Rationale: a distillation that drops an obligation, its modality, or its verification binding has not compressed the spec — it has **changed what gets built**. The loss budget makes that the bright line.

### 24.1 What MAY be abstracted or dropped

At any distillation boundary, the following MAY be abstracted, summarized, or dropped entirely, because none of it carries binding force:

| Droppable | Where it survives instead |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| Commentary and narrative prose | The source artifact (linked, not copied). |
| Redundant restatements | The single canonical statement. |
| Rationale already recorded elsewhere | The ADR / finding / research it came from. |
| Rejected options, source digressions, low-confidence observations | The `research.md` (§24.4 table). |
| Step-by-step execution logs | The `task.md` and the trace. |

### 24.2 What MUST survive every distillation

The following MUST survive intact across **every** boundary. Dropping or weakening any of them is a **distillation error** (lint `SOL-V001`/`SOL-M…` family, §8), not a stylistic choice:

| Must survive | Why |
| ------------ | --- |
| The obligation itself (its ID) | The traceability key (§4); losing it severs backward trace (§22.5). |
| Its modality (`MUST`/`MUST NOT`/`SHOULD`/…) | Modality *is* the binding force (§4); losing it neutralizes the obligation. |
| Its verification bindings (`VERIFY BY …`) | An obligation with no proof path is `UNVERIFIED` (§14, §15). |
| Its authority and scope | The domain/artifact rank (§22) and `WRITES`/`READS`/`AFFECTS` scope (§18). |
| Constraints, invariants, non-goals, unresolved `QUESTION`s | These bound the build; dropping a non-goal silently widens scope. |

This specification's loss-budget matrix is canonical and reproduced here as the per-boundary specialization of these two lists:

| From | To | Permitted loss | Forbidden loss |
| ---- | -- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `research.md` | `spec.swarm.md` | Source digressions, rejected options, low-confidence observations | Constraints, unresolved ambiguity, decision-changing evidence |
| `audit.md` | `spec.swarm.md` | Low-priority cleanup details | Observed risks affecting target behavior |
| `bug-report.md` | fix task | Duplicate failed reproduction attempts | Reliable reproduction, expected/actual behavior, root-cause evidence |
| `spec.swarm.md` | task | Rationale not needed for execution | Obligation IDs, modality, constraints, invariants, verification bindings, non-goals |
| `finding.md` | task | Historical discussion | Actionable claim, applicability, evidence |
| `task.md` | `finding.md` | Step-by-step execution log | Evidence for the durable claim |
| task output | trace | Narrative detail | Obligation ID, changed files, proof |
| trace | review verdict | Implementation chatter | Claim, evidence, pass/fail reason |

### 24.3 The budget is a discipline, not a gatekeeper

The loss budget is **enforced by source authority (§22) plus lint (§8)** — it is not, and MUST NOT be implemented as, a "documentation-gatekeeper" skill or persona. Rationale: a gatekeeper is soft control (a model deciding whether to allow a passage, §2 / §17), so it can be talked past; a lint rule plus an authority comparison are deterministic checks against the typed obligation set.

Concretely:
- **Lint** catches a distillation error structurally: a lowered task that omits an obligation ID its source spec declares, or a `VERIFY BY` binding present in the spec but absent in the task, is a `SOL-V001`/`SOL-M…` diagnostic.
- **Source authority** catches it semantically: a distilled artifact that contradicts its higher-authority source is a `SOL-M002` contradiction (§22.2), routed to amendment — the distillation cannot silently win.

The **`spec.swarm.md` distillation loss statement** (the `Preserved / Dropped / Still uncertain` section, §21) is the human-authored declaration the lint checks against. It records what the author *intends* to be droppable, so the loss is auditable rather than accidental.

### 24.4 Forbidden compositions

A **forbidden composition** is the silent mixing of two distinct epistemic stances — most dangerously, an **observation-only artifact silently becoming intent**. Examples: an `audit.md` (observation of present state) read as if it were an approved `spec.swarm.md` (intended behavior); a `research.md` (exploratory) treated as a decision; a `bug-report.md` (diagnosis) treated as a fix authorization.

These compositions are prevented by the **loss budget + source authority**, NOT by a documentation-gatekeeper:

- The **loss budget** forces the crossing to be explicit: an audit *promotes to* a spec through the `audit.md → spec.swarm.md` row of §24.2, which is an authoring act that re-states observations as obligations with their own IDs, modality, and verification bindings. There is no path by which an audit's prose becomes binding without that re-statement.
- **Source authority** ranks the stances: an `audit` (Axis A rank 4, observation) cannot silently amend an approved `spec` (rank 2); if it appears to, that is a `SOL-M002` contradiction routed to review (§22.2).

> Worked example — an `audit.md` notes "the refresh endpoint currently accepts rotated tokens." This is an **observation**, not intent. To affect the build it must promote into `spec.swarm.md` as a re-stated obligation (`CONSTRAINT C-014`, §22.3) carrying modality and `VERIFY BY`. The audit prose alone has Axis-A rank 4 and `audit`/`security` domain; it never silently overwrites the product spec — the §22 conflict procedure governs, and the loss budget forces the explicit re-statement. The epistemic stance is preserved end-to-end: an observation stayed labeled an observation until an author deliberately turned it into intent.

The conformant repo's distillation-loss-budget reference (`docs/reference/distillation-loss-budget.md`, §20) MUST state both lists (§24.1, §24.2), the per-boundary matrix, the discipline-not-gatekeeper rule, and the forbidden-composition treatment.

## 25. Versioning

Swarm has **two independent version axes**. Conflating them is a category error: one tracks the *meaning of the language*, the other tracks *the package that delivers it*. A conformant repo MUST track both and MUST NOT merge them into a single number.

### 25.1 The two axes

| Axis | What it versions | Where it lives | Cadence |
| ---- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| **Language version** | The SOL + APS feature set: grammar, the 7 block types, the 5 modals, the clause keywords, the `SOL-<LAYER>NNN` lint codes (§4–§8) | Per-file frontmatter: `swarm_language` + `aps_version` | Small, slow-moving: `0.1`, `0.2`, `1.0` |
| **Framework / package version** | The scaffold, templates, skills/pass guides, personas/profiles, flow-graph (§20, §21, §26–§29) | `scaffold/.agents/.swarm-version` → `.swarm/VERSION` (semver) | Ordinary semver; may move many times between language bumps |

Rationale: this mirrors how a language version is a distinct axis from the package/toolchain version — e.g. C# `LangVersion` (overridable from its target-framework default but bounded by the installed compiler `[CSLANG]`) and Rust editions vs `rust-version` vs cargo/rustc `[RUSTED]` — so the *language API* (grammar + lint codes) and the *package API* (template sections + skills + flow-graph) are versioned as separately-named public APIs, and SemVer is only meaningful when each public API is named explicitly.

#### 25.1.1 Language version

The language version answers "**which grammar, blocks, modals, and lint codes does this file speak?**" It is carried **per file** so that a single repo MAY contain `spec.swarm.md` files at different language versions during a migration.

- `swarm_language` is the **SOL discriminator**, written `SOL/0.1`.
- `aps_version` is the **APS prose-standard version**, written `0.1`.

#### 25.1.2 Framework / package version

The framework version answers "**which scaffold, templates, and pass guides shipped this repo?**" It is a single semver string in `scaffold/.agents/.swarm-version` (an adopted project mirrors it as `.swarm/VERSION`, §20.5.1). This **extends ADR 0015** (which established `.agents/.swarm-version`); ADR 0015 is *extended, not replaced* (§30) — it is scoped to the package axis and the language axis is added alongside it.

### 25.2 The one-way trigger

The axes are independent, but coupled by exactly **one** directional rule:

> **Any change to the SOL/APS language version MUST force at least a framework MINOR release** — additive language change → framework MINOR; breaking language change → framework MAJOR. The framework MAY release any number of versions (PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR) **without** changing the language version.
>
> **SemVer 0.y.z caveat.** While both axes are at major-version-zero, SemVer 2.0.0 §4 holds that *anything MAY change at any time* `[SEMVER]`, so this trigger is **advisory until each axis reaches 1.0**. Even after 1.0 it is a one-directional *floor* (a language change forces at least a framework MINOR), not a guarantee that every framework release re-issues the language — mirroring Rust editions plus the MSRV floor (independent axes, one-way constraint) `[RUSTED]`, not a fixed release cadence.

```text
language change ──(MUST)──▶ framework MINOR (additive) or MAJOR (breaking)
framework change ──(MAY)──▶ no language change required
```

Rationale: a new keyword or lint code changes what the templates and pass guides must teach, so the package that ships them MUST move; but fixing a template typo or adding a skill never changes the grammar, so the language MUST stay pinned. The trigger is **one-way**: language ⇒ framework, never framework ⇒ language.

### 25.3 Three distinct version fields in the IR/plan

The emitted IR (§12) and plan (§13) MUST echo **three distinct fields**, and a conformant tool MUST NOT merge any two of them:

| Field | Axis / meaning | Example |
| ----- | -------------- | ------- |
| `meta.language` | The SOL **discriminator** (which grammar this IR was parsed under) | `"SOL/0.1"` |
| `meta.version` | The **spec content version** (the semver of *this spec's intent*, independent of language and framework) | `"0.1.0"` |
| `provenance.compiler_version` | The **tool version** that emitted the IR, when a tool exists | `"0.0.0"` / unset today (no runtime, §2) |

```json
{
 "meta": {
 "language": "SOL/0.1",
 "version": "0.1.0",
 "title": "auth-refresh"
 },
 "provenance": {
 "compiler_version": null
 }
}
```

These answer three different questions — *which grammar* (`meta.language`), *which revision of this spec's intent* (`meta.version`), *which tool produced this* (`provenance.compiler_version`) — and a single number cannot answer all three.

### 25.4 G10 — frontmatter normalization (normative)

To unblock the §25.3 three-field mapping, the kernel pins one canonical frontmatter vocabulary across **all** `.swarm.md` and template files (G10):

```text
---
swarm_language: SOL/0.1 # SOL discriminator (= meta.language in the IR)
aps_version: 0.1 # APS prose-standard version
spec_version: 0.1.0 # spec content version (= meta.version in the IR)
---
```

| Frontmatter field | Maps to IR field | Axis |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---- |
| `swarm_language: SOL/0.1` | `meta.language` | Language (discriminator) |
| `aps_version: 0.1` | (not echoed in IR; governs prose lint layer `SOL-P…`) | Language |
| `spec_version: 0.1.0` | `meta.version` | Spec content |

Conformance note: earlier draft templates currently write `swarm_language: 0.1` (a bare number). The normalized form is `swarm_language: SOL/0.1` (with the `SOL/` discriminator) and a separate `spec_version`. A conformant repo MUST use the normalized form; a bare `swarm_language: 0.1` is a `SOL-S…`-class frontmatter diagnostic. The framework version is **never** written in per-file frontmatter — it lives only in the framework version file (`scaffold/.agents/.swarm-version`; `.swarm/VERSION` in an adopted project, §20.5.1).

Key resolutions encoded, all marked NORMATIVE per this specification:
- **§22**: two orthogonal axes applied lexicographically (domain first via Axis B, then artifact via Axis A), the three-step conflict rule terminating in `SOL-M002`, the worked security-audit-beats-product-spec tie-break, the three cross-axis invariants, and the backward-trace/forward-governing-force framing.
- **§23**: two-tier provenance-anchored model (Tier-1 INDEX map + glossary with the load-when discipline; Tier-2 immutable evidence store + patterns), full mandatory provenance field set, promotion status enum with task-close gate, the **G9** tie-break (pass-guide edit + one-line AGENTS.md pointer, never inline procedure), `candidate|accepted|promoted|rejected|stale|superseded` staleness tied to §16, and the post-v0.1 deferral table.
- **§24**: MAY-drop vs MUST-survive lists, the per-boundary matrix, the discipline-not-gatekeeper rule (lint + source authority), and forbidden-compositions prevention via loss budget + source authority.
- **§25**: the two axes, the one-way trigger (language ⇒ framework MINOR/MAJOR), the three never-merged IR fields, and the **G10** frontmatter normalization (`swarm_language: SOL/0.1`, `aps_version: 0.1`, `spec_version: 0.1.0`).
