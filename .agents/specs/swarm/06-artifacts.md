# Swarm Kernel Specification v0.1 — Part 06: Artifacts and templates

<!-- Part 06 of the Swarm Kernel Specification (§20–§21). All parts share one section numbering (§0–§35 + Appendices A–G); cross-references of the form “§N” resolve via the index in [README.md](./README.md). -->

## 20. The artifact set and conformance definition

This section defines the complete set of files a Swarm repository may contain, partitions them into two normative classes by the `.swarm.` filename infix, enumerates the canonical filenames in each class, and fixes the tiered required-artifact set on which conformance is defined. The per-artifact *contracts* and copyable *templates* are specified in §21; the mechanically-checkable conformance procedure is specified in §32.

### 20.0 Repository layout

This subsection is the single canonical map of every path this specification names. It precedes the artifact partition (§20.1) and the conformance definition (§20.4) so a reader can locate any artifact, template, or reference doc by its directory before reading the rules that govern it. The tree below is normative for path *shape* (which directory an artifact lives in); the conformance definition (§20.4) — not this tree — fixes which paths a conformant repository MUST contain.

A repository has four top-level concerns, each a sibling directory: `docs/` (prose that *explains* Swarm), `examples/` (worked good/bad specs that *demonstrate* it), `evals/` (framework self-tests that *measure the framework itself*), and `scaffold/.agents/` (the installable payload — the kernel — that a consuming repo *adopts*).

**Note — the installable payload directory.** The installable payload directory is `scaffold/.agents/`; it is conceptually "the kernel" — the unitary framework a consuming repository adopts wholesale (§2). A consumer copies the contents of `scaffold/.agents/` to its own `.agents/` and adopts `scaffold/AGENTS.md` as `AGENTS.md`. A v0.2 ADR MAY rename `scaffold/` → `kernel/` to make the conceptual name literal; if it does, `scaffold/` MUST be kept as a one-cycle compatibility alias so in-flight adopters do not break, and the alias MUST be removed no later than the following MINOR release. The rename is cosmetic: it changes the payload's directory name, never the `.agents/` interior, the artifact filenames (§20.2), or the conformance definition (§20.4).

**Note — `evals/` is not the conformance suite.** `evals/` and `scaffold/.agents/conformance/fixtures/` are distinct and MUST NOT be conflated. `evals/` holds the *framework's self-tests* — the `evals/fixtures/` inputs and the `evals/rubrics/` per-pass quality rubrics (§33.6) that measure whether *this specification and its scaffold* hold together; it is authoring-side and is not part of the installable payload. `scaffold/.agents/conformance/fixtures/` holds the *shipped conformance suite* — the golden corpus (§33) that a consuming repository carries to validate *its own* adoption against the conformance contract (§32). The first tests the kernel; the second is tested *by* every kernel adopter. Neither directory executes anything (Invariant 1, NO RUNTIME — §2): both are inert data a future tool would consume.

### 20.1 The `.swarm.` infix rule (normative)

Swarm partitions every repository file that participates in the pipeline into exactly two classes, discriminated by whether the filename carries the literal infix `.swarm.` before its final extension.

| Class | Rule | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compiler-visible | The filename MUST contain the `.swarm.` infix (e.g. `auth.swarm.md`, `auth.swarm.ir.json`). | The file is *parsed or emitted by the compiler*. It is either the human-authored SOL source or a contract-shaped output a future tool produces. Its byte content is subject to the SOL grammar (§5–§6) or the IR/plan JSON schemas (§12–§13, Appendix C). |
| Working artifact | The filename MUST NOT contain `.swarm.` and uses a plain `.md` extension (e.g. `task.md`, `review.md`). | The file is a *human/agent working artifact*: a lowered work packet, a verdict record, a durable fact, a decision, or a recall map. It is structured Markdown governed by an artifact contract (§21), not by the SOL grammar, though it MAY embed SOL blocks (notably VERDICT and TRACE) as quoted data. |

A conformant Swarm tool MUST treat the `.swarm.` infix as the sole, sufficient discriminator for "do I parse/emit this": it MUST NOT attempt to parse a plain `.md` working artifact as a SOL source, and it MUST NOT emit a compiler output to a path lacking the infix. *Rationale:* the double-extension convention (`.test.ts`, `.d.ts`) lets tooling select files by a stable, greppable suffix without content inspection.

The only human-authored `.swarm.` artifact is `*.swarm.md` (the source spec). The three `.swarm.*.json`/`.swarm.trace.md` variants are *emitted* artifacts; see §20.2.2.

### 20.2 Canonical filenames by class

#### 20.2.1 Compiler-visible artifacts (`.swarm.` infix)

| Filename pattern | Role | Authored by | Schema / grammar | Status in v0.1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `*.swarm.md` | Source spec — prose (APS) interleaved with SOL blocks. | Human / authoring agent | SOL surface grammar (§5–§6), APS prose standard (§7) | Live; the only hand-written `.swarm.` file. |
| `*.swarm.ir.json` | Emitted intermediate representation (the obligation graph). | Compiler (future tool) | IR envelope (§12, Appendix C) | **Reserved contract name.** Not written by any shipped tool in v0.1. |
| `*.swarm.plan.json` | Emitted plan (lowered, schedulable work packets + graphs). | Compiler/planner (future tool) | Plan envelope (§13) | **Reserved contract name.** Not written by any shipped tool in v0.1. |
| `*.swarm.trace.md` | Emitted/instantiated trace for a built spec. | Implement/verify pass (today: agent by hand) | Trace contract (§21.4) + §16 provenance | Copyable template is `trace.md` (plain); built *instances* MAY take the `*.swarm.trace.md` name. |

The `.json` variants are **documented-as-contract names only**: the kernel pins their shape so a future launcher can build against a stable target, but Swarm ships no parser, emitter, planner, or checker (Invariant 1, NO RUNTIME — see §2). A v0.1 repository MUST NOT claim that any `*.swarm.ir.json` or `*.swarm.plan.json` is produced by a Swarm tool; it MAY contain hand-written examples in the golden corpus (§33).

#### 20.2.2 Working artifacts (plain `.md`)

| Filename | Role | Template tier (§20.3) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task.md` | Lowered work packet / pass frame for one pass (§28). | Core (required) |
| `trace.md` | Implementation/preservation claims + evidence against obligations. | Core (required) |
| `review.md` | The verdict record: per-obligation VERDICT blocks + matrix + final verdict. | Core (required) |
| `finding.md` | One durable, provenance-anchored project fact. | Core (required) |
| `adr.md` | An immutable architecture this specification (Nygard form). | Core (required) |
| `memory/INDEX.md` | Compact recall map (links + a "Load when" per entry). | Core (required) |
| `memory/glossary.md` | One-word-one-meaning term store. | Memory model (§23) |
| `memory/patterns/*.md` | Recurring multi-finding knowledge. | Memory model (§23) |
| `audit.md` | Observation-only source artifact; promotes to a spec. | Stdlib source-doc (conditional) |
| `research.md` | Investigation source artifact; promotes to a spec. | Stdlib source-doc (conditional) |
| `bug-report.md` | Diagnosis-only source artifact; promotes into a fix *task*. | Stdlib source-doc (conditional) |

#### 20.2.3 There is NO `verdict.md` (normative)

A repository MUST NOT contain a standalone `verdict.md` artifact, and no tool MAY emit one. `VERDICT` is a SOL *language block* (§6), not a file; `review.md` is its canonical *container* (§21.5). *Rationale:* a verdict is the output of the review pass, exactly as a SARIF `result` lives inside a `run` and never as a free-standing file. The kernel ships documentation of the VERDICT block and the verdict taxonomy (§14) as a reference page, not as a copyable artifact template.

### 20.3 The tiered required-artifact set

The required set is partitioned into three tiers. Only Tiers 1 and 2 are load-bearing for conformance; Tier 3 is shipped but conditional.

#### 20.3.1 Tier 1 — kernel-required pipeline core (contract + copyable template each)

Seven artifacts. Each MUST ship both (a) a documented contract (the required sections/fields and their meaning) and (b) a copyable template skeleton. All seven contracts and templates are given in §21.

| # | Artifact | Class | Pipeline role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `spec.swarm.md` | compiler-visible | Source of obligations. |
| 2 | `task.md` | working | Lowered pass frame. |
| 3 | `trace.md` | working | Implementation claims + evidence. |
| 4 | `review.md` | working | Verdict record (verdict container). |
| 5 | `finding.md` | working | Durable fact (memory Tier-2 evidence). |
| 6 | `adr.md` | working | Immutable decision. |
| 7 | `memory/INDEX.md` | working | Recall map (memory Tier-1). |

#### 20.3.2 Tier 2 — kernel-required language / reference docs (not templates)

Six reference documents. These are *prose-and-table reference pages*, not copyable artifact templates; a conformant repo MUST contain a self-contained copy of each so the repository explains its own language without external dependency.

| # | Reference doc | Defines | Spec home |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | SOL reference | Surface syntax + block-type reference. | §5–§6 |
| 2 | APS reference | The controlled-prose standard. | §7 |
| 3 | Error / lint taxonomy | The `SOL-<LAYER><NNN>` catalogue with stable codes + severities. | §8, Appendix B |
| 4 | Source-authority | The two-axis authority model + tie-break. | §22 |
| 5 | Promotion-protocol | The promotion statuses + workflow. | §23 |
| 6 | Distillation-loss-budget | The Preserved/Dropped/Still-uncertain discipline + loss accounting. | §24 |

#### 20.3.3 Tier 3 — stdlib source-doc templates (shipped, conditional)

Three source-document templates the stdlib ships so common authoring entry points exist. They are *conditional*: a repo need not have instantiated any of them to be conformant, but a conformant scaffold MUST ship the templates.

| # | Template | Epistemic stance | Promotes to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `audit.md` | Observation-only (records what *is*, never prescribes). | a `spec.swarm.md` (via author pass). |
| 2 | `research.md` | Investigation (open questions + findings). | a `spec.swarm.md` (via author pass). |
| 3 | `bug-report.md` | Diagnosis-only (root cause, never fix). | a fix `task.md` (`task_kind: fix`). |

#### 20.3.4 Supported parents of a spec

A spec is not born only from research. Requirements practice distinguishes intent, evidence, proposal, decision, observation, defect, discovery, scenario, interface, and quality-attribute artefacts; Swarm normalizes all of them into one obligation-bearing `spec.swarm.md` rather than pretending every intent begins as research. The canonical upstream-source model — the recognized **parents** of a spec — is:

| Source class | Canonical artefact | Contributes | May feed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intent | `prd.md` | user outcomes, goals, non-goals, success metrics, release constraints | specs, RFCs |
| Evidence | `research.md` | external facts, comparisons, feasibility, standards, risks, confidence | PRDs, RFCs, specs, ADRs, findings |
| Proposal | `rfc.md` | candidate technical approach, alternatives, migration plan | ADRs, specs |
| Decision | `adr.md` | accepted architectural or product constraints and trade-offs | specs, tasks |
| Observation | `audit.md` | present-state risks, debt, drift, duplication, unsafe patterns | findings, specs, refactor tasks |
| Defect | `bug-report.md` | reproduced failure, expected vs. actual behavior, impact | fix tasks, spec amendments |
| Discovery | `finding.md` | one durable, evidenced fact learned during work | specs, ADRs, memory |
| Scenario / example | `use-case.md`, `examples`, acceptance tests | concrete behavior, actor-goal interactions, edge cases | `REQ` blocks + the verification matrix (§21.2) |
| Interface source | OpenAPI, GraphQL schema, DB schema, design contract | boundary shapes and compatibility constraints | `INTERFACE` + `CONSTRAINT` blocks |
| Quality attributes | `nfr.md`, SLOs, accessibility/security briefs | performance, reliability, privacy, accessibility, security | `REQ` / `CONSTRAINT` / `INVARIANT` blocks |

`research.md` holds a special role as the kernel's **detached first-class evidence store**: it is not bound to one downstream artefact, and one research artefact MAY feed many PRDs, specs, ADRs, findings, or audits at once. Keeping evidence detached minimizes copying, preserves provenance, and reduces distillation loss (§24) when upstream facts evolve.

Of these parents, `prd.md` (stance: **intent**) and `rfc.md` (stance: **proposal**) join `audit.md`, `research.md`, and `bug-report.md` as Tier-3 **stdlib source-doc templates** — shipped in the scaffold, CONDITIONAL, and never conformance-required (§20.4): a conformant repo need not have instantiated any of them, but a conformant scaffold MUST ship each template. By contrast, `use-case.md`/examples, `nfr.md`/SLOs, and interface sources are **recognized inputs that normalize INTO `spec.swarm.md`** during the `author` pass (§9) — they emit `REQ`/`CONSTRAINT`/`INVARIANT`/`INTERFACE` blocks plus verification-matrix rows directly — and are not necessarily shipped as separate templates. A conformant scaffold therefore SHOULD ship `prd.md` and `rfc.md` templates alongside the existing three (extending the Tier-3 table of §20.3.3 to five), and MAY additionally ship a `use-case.md` or `nfr.md` template, but MUST NOT treat any Tier-3 source-doc as required for conformance.

> **Insert into §29 (epistemic-stance catalogue):** PRD (intent), RFC (proposal), use-case/example (scenario), NFR/SLO (quality attribute), and interface sources (OpenAPI/GraphQL/DB schema) are first-class parents of a spec, and their epistemic stances are preserved on promotion — intent and proposal remain non-authoritative until an `author` pass turns them into spec obligations, exactly as observation and inquiry do.

### 20.4 The conformance definition (normative)

A repository is **Swarm-conformant** if and only if all of the following hold:

1. It contains a self-contained copy of all six **Tier-2 language/reference docs** (§20.3.2).
2. It contains a copyable template for each of the seven **Tier-1 core artifacts** (§20.3.1), and each template satisfies its §21 contract.
3. It contains a **populated `AGENTS.md` bootloader** (§31) — not an empty placeholder — within the ≤200-line / ≤25 KB density cap (§2, §17).
4. It contains the framework version file **`.agents/.swarm-version`** (§25), carrying a valid semver.

A repository that omits any of the four MUST NOT be described as Swarm-conformant. Conditional artifacts (Tier 3) and the reserved `.swarm.*.json` contract files are **not** required for conformance. The full mechanically-checkable conformance contract — the exact checks, their inputs, and the deferral of an automated checker to a future CLI — is given in §32; the golden corpus that exercises it is given in §33.

---

## 21. Artifact contracts and templates

This section gives, for each of the seven Tier-1 core artifacts, (a) its **contract** — the required sections/fields and what each means — and (b) a copyable **template skeleton** as a fenced block. Brief notes follow for the three Tier-3 stdlib source-docs. Surface fields in templates use the canonical space-separated uppercase SOL keywords; frontmatter uses the normalized field names fixed in G10 (`swarm_language: SOL/0.1`, `aps_version: 0.1`, `spec_version: 0.1.0`). Templates reuse the source-doc skeletons wherever this specification affirms them, upgraded to the canonical vocabulary of §4 (7-value verdicts, `VERIFY BY <type>:<adapter>:<artifact>`, provenance fields).

### 21.1 General template conventions (normative)

- Every artifact MUST carry YAML frontmatter delimited by `---` with at minimum a `type` field naming the artifact and an `id`.
- Placeholder tokens use `{{...}}`. A shipped, *uninstantiated* template MUST NOT leave a binding clause as a `{{...}}` placeholder inside a populated artifact; an unfilled `VERIFY BY` placeholder in a built artifact is a `SOL-V001` defect (§8).
- Tables are the required carrier for every matrix (verification, obligation-verdict, promotion queue). A row whose status cell is empty in a *built* artifact is treated as `UNVERIFIED`.
- Surface SOL blocks embedded in a working artifact (TRACE in `trace.md`, VERDICT in `review.md`) are quoted SOL data and MUST obey the SOL block grammar (§6).

### 21.2 `spec.swarm.md` — the source spec

#### 21.2.1 Contract

A spec is a behavioral contract: APS prose interleaved with SOL obligation blocks, which compiles into the obligation graph. A conformant `spec.swarm.md` MUST contain the following sections, in order. Omitting any required section, or presenting them out of order, is a document-level defect `lint` MUST raise as `SOL-S012` (§8.3, Appendix B) — distinct from the per-obligation scope code `SOL-O004` (an obligation lacking `WRITES`/`READS`/`AFFECTS`). The required sections, in order:

| Section | Meaning | Carries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| frontmatter | Identity + the two version axes. | `type: spec`, `id`, `swarm_language: SOL/0.1`, `aps_version`, `spec_version`, `status`, `created`, `updated`. |
| `## Intent` | One paragraph: the user- or system-visible outcome. | APS prose. |
| `## Non-goals` | Explicit out-of-scope, to bound interpretation. | APS prose / bullets. |
| `## Context` | Only load-bearing background; links, not pastes. | APS prose + links to findings/ADRs/audits. |
| `## Interfaces` | Boundary declarations. | `INTERFACE` blocks (each MUST bind `VERIFY BY contract:…`, §15). |
| `## Obligations` | The binding behavioral requirements. | `REQ` blocks. |
| `## Constraints` | Forbidden actions / restrictions. | `CONSTRAINT` blocks. |
| `## Invariants` | Properties that must hold. | `INVARIANT` blocks (prefer `property\|model\|static` proofs). |
| `## Questions` | Captured ambiguity. | `QUESTION` blocks (`blocking` ones MUST be resolved before lowering, §11). |
| `## Verification coverage` | Per-obligation proof binding, at a glance. | Table: ID → `VERIFY BY` reference. |
| `## Downstream tasks` | Which task frames cover which obligations. | Table: Task → Covers. |
| `## Distillation loss statement` | Preserved / Dropped / Still-uncertain (§24). | Three subsections. |

### 21.3 `task.md` — the pass frame

#### 21.3.1 Contract

A task is a *pass frame and execution companion*: the lowered work packet for one pass over assigned source. `task_kind` is a frontmatter enum that parameterizes which pass runs (forward-ref §28). The frontmatter MUST carry the orchestration scope fields so the lowering pass can prove disjointness (§18): `assigned_obligations`, `write_surfaces`, `verification_bindings`, plus the coordination fields `parallel_group`, `blocked_by`. A conformant `task.md` MUST contain:

| Section | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| frontmatter | `type: task`, `id`, `status`, `task_kind` (enum), `source`, `assigned_obligations`, `constraints`, `invariants`, `interfaces`, `write_surfaces`, `verification_bindings`, `parallel_group`, `blocked_by`, `produces`. |
| `## Parent contract` | The inherited hand-off contract: objective + deliverable + acceptance bar + boundaries (owned vs forbidden paths). |
| `## Scope` | An explicit **In / Out** list bounding the pass. |
| `## Assigned obligations` | The exact assigned SOL blocks, pasted verbatim. |
| `## Constraints and invariants` | The SOL blocks this task MUST preserve. |
| `## Implementation or pass trace` | What changed, per obligation. |
| `## Verification matrix` | Required proof → actual proof → 7-value status, per obligation. |
| `## Promotion queue` | Discoveries with target + promotion status (§23); all MUST be resolved before task close. |
| `## Self-review` | The structured self-review block (did I do only this pass; preserve semantics; map every claim to evidence). |

`write_surfaces` MUST be a subset of the assigned obligations' `WRITES` surfaces; an owned path outside a declared write surface is a `SOL-O005` defect (§8, G7).

### 21.4 `trace.md` — implementation claims

#### 21.4.1 Contract

A trace records implementation *claims* against obligations and binds them to *evidence*. Its core payload is one or more `TRACE` blocks (`IMPLEMENTS` / `PRESERVES` / `CHANGED` / `PROOF`, §6) plus the drift-provenance fields from §16 that the staleness join depends on. A conformant `trace.md` MUST contain:

| Section | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| frontmatter | `type: trace`, `id`, `source_task`, `source_spec`, `created`. |
| `## Claimed implementation` | The `TRACE` blocks. |
| `## Provenance` | The §16 / G11 fields **per binding**: `source_hash` (obligation content hash at PASS), `per_surface_hash[]` (each declared `WRITES` file hash/SHA), `adapter`, `verdict`, `tier`, `timestamp`. These are what flips a PASS to `STALE` when source or surface drifts (§16). |
| `## Verification matrix` | ID → required proof → actual proof → 7-value status. |
| `## Unassigned changes` | Any change outside assigned obligations, with reason + authorizing ID or `none`. |
| `## Promotion items` | Discoveries to promote, with target + status. |

### 21.5 `review.md` — the verdict record

#### 21.5.1 Contract

A review compares trace claims against obligations, constraints, invariants, diffs, and verification evidence. **This artifact IS the verdict record**: it is the canonical container of `VERDICT` blocks, and there is no `verdict.md` (§20.2.3). A conformant `review.md` MUST contain:

| Section | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| frontmatter | `type: review`, `id`, `source_trace`, `source_spec`, `reviewed_output`, `pass`, `profile` (e.g. `skeptic`), `created`. |
| `## Per-obligation verdicts` | One `VERDICT` block per judged obligation, using the canonical verdict line: `VERDICT <id>: <CORE> [(<lifecycle> by <authority>: <reason>)]` plus `REASON` / `EVIDENCE`. Core ∈ {PASS, FAIL, BLOCKED, UNVERIFIED}; lifecycle ∈ {WAIVED, STALE, CONTRADICTED} (§14). |
| `## Obligation-verdict matrix` | A compact table of every obligation ID → core verdict → lifecycle → evidence checked. |
| `## Constraint and invariant verdicts` | The same, for `C-` and `I-` IDs. |
| `## Unauthorized changes` | Every change not traceable to an authorizing obligation, judged allowed / suspect / reject. |
| `## Final verdict` | The merge-gate result: merge iff every required obligation is `PASS` or `WAIVED`, none `STALE`/`CONTRADICTED`/`FAIL`/`BLOCKED`/`UNVERIFIED` (§14). |
| `## Promotion queue` | Items to promote, with target + status. |

A WAIVED verdict MUST name authority + reason + expiry; a STALE verdict MUST cite the prior-verdict ref + changed surface; a CONTRADICTED verdict MUST cite the two conflicting evidence refs (§14).

### 21.6 `finding.md` — a durable fact

#### 21.6.1 Contract

A finding is one durable, provenance-anchored project fact discovered during work; it is the Tier-2 evidence store the memory index (§23) links into. Every promoted finding MUST carry the full provenance set so its staleness can be computed and its applicability scoped. A conformant `finding.md` MUST contain:

| Field / section | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `status` (frontmatter enum) | `candidate \| accepted \| promoted \| rejected \| stale \| superseded`. Goes `stale` when `content_hash` no longer matches the cited source/surfaces (§16). |
| `## Claim` | The one durable fact. |
| `## Evidence` | File / command / output / source references. |
| provenance fields | `origin_obligations[]`, `origin_traces[]`, `pass` + `profile`, `reviewer_or_tool`, `timestamp`, `content_hash`, `confidence`. |
| `## Applies when` / `## Does not apply when` | Scope conditions (mandatory; if it cannot name when it applies, it MUST NOT be promoted). |
| `## Promotion target` | The promotion route (spec / audit / ADR / memory pattern / keep-scoped / stale). |
| `## Status history` | Append-only status transitions. |

#### 21.6.2 Template

### 21.7 `adr.md` — an immutable decision

#### 21.7.1 Contract

An ADR records one architecture decision in Nygard form. ADRs are **immutable**: an accepted ADR is never edited in place; "amending" it means writing a *new* superseding ADR and setting the old one's status to `superseded`. A conformant `adr.md` MUST contain the four Nygard elements — context, decision, consequences, status — plus the supersession link fields:

| Section | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| frontmatter | `type: adr`, `id`, `status` (`proposed \| accepted \| superseded \| rejected`), `supersedes`, `superseded_by`, `created`, `updated`. |
| `## Context` | What forced the decision. |
| `## Decision` | What was chosen. |
| `## Consequences` | Positive / negative / neutral tradeoffs. |
| status linkage | An amended ADR gets only a `Superseded by ADR-00XX` status line; its body stays immutable. |

#### 21.7.2 Template

```markdown

### 21.8 `memory/INDEX.md` — the recall map

#### 21.8.1 Contract

The memory index is a compact **MAP** — links, not explanations. It is the Tier-1 entry point that links into the Tier-2 evidence store (findings, ADRs, patterns, glossary). Every entry MUST carry a `Load when` condition; an entry that cannot name when it matters MUST be removed. A conformant `memory/INDEX.md` MUST contain:

| Section | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| frontmatter | `type: memory-index`, `id: memory-index`, `status: active`, `updated`. |
| `## Always-relevant project facts` | The few facts loaded every task. |
| `## Topic files` | Table: Topic → file → **Load when**. |
| `## Durable findings` | Table: Finding → status → **Load when**. |
| `## Decisions` | Table: ADR → status → **Load when**. |
| `## Stale or superseded memory` | Table: Item → replacement → action. |

#### 21.8.2 Template

# Memory index

## Purpose

The compact map of durable project knowledge. Read before tasks that may depend

### 21.9 Tier-3 stdlib source-doc templates (brief notes)

The stdlib ships three source-document templates (§20.3.3). Each is plain `.md`, carries `type` + `id` frontmatter, and preserves a fixed *epistemic stance* enforced by the distillation-loss + source-authority discipline (§22, §24), not by a gatekeeper skill.

| Template | Required sections | Stance rule | Promotion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `audit.md` | `## Scope`, `## Observations` (evidence-cited), `## Risks`, `## Recommended obligations`. | Observation-only: records what *is*; MUST NOT prescribe a fix inline. | Promotes to a `spec.swarm.md` via the author pass. |
| `research.md` | `## Question`, `## Findings` (each → a `finding.md`), `## Open questions`, `## Recommendation`. | Investigation: open questions remain `QUESTION` candidates until resolved. | Promotes to a `spec.swarm.md` via the author pass. |
| `bug-report.md` | `## Symptom`, `## Reproduction`, `## Root cause`, `## Affected obligations`. | Diagnosis-only: MUST NOT contain the fix; states the broken obligation. | Promotes into a fix `task.md` (`task_kind: fix`), never directly into code. |

#### 21.10 PRD and RFC source-doc templates (stdlib, conditional)

These two stdlib source-doc templates extend the Tier-3 set of §21.9. Like `audit.md`, `research.md`, and `bug-report.md`, each is plain `.md`, carries `type` + `id` frontmatter, and preserves a fixed *epistemic stance* enforced by the distillation-loss and source-authority discipline (§22, §24), not by any gatekeeper tool. They are **conditional**: a conformant repo MUST ship the templates in `scaffold/.agents/` but MAY have zero instances — a `prd.md` is required only when a change introduces or reshapes intended product behaviour, and an `rfc.md` is required only when a technical approach needs a decision before it is committed to an approved `spec.swarm.md` or an `adr.md`. Both promote forward through the author pass; neither carries obligation blocks itself (§21.10.3).

##### 21.10.1 `prd.md` — product intent

A PRD captures the **product intent** behind a body of work: the problem, the affected users, and the outcomes that define success — never the mechanism. Its stance is **intent-only**: it states *what outcome is wanted and why*, and MUST NOT author `REQ`/`CONSTRAINT`/`INVARIANT`/`INTERFACE` obligation blocks (those are produced when it promotes to a `spec.swarm.md` via the author pass). It is required when a change initiates new product behaviour or alters the scope of existing behaviour, so that downstream obligations have a single, citable source of intent. A conformant `prd.md` MUST contain:

| Section | Meaning | Stance rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| frontmatter | `type: prd`, `id`, `status` (`draft \| accepted \| superseded`), `created`, `updated`. | — |
| `## Problem` | The user/business problem in plain prose. | States the problem, not a solution. |
| `## Users` | Who is affected; the segments the outcome serves. | — |
| `## Goals` | The outcomes that define success (intent, not mechanism). | Outcome statements, never `REQ` blocks. |
| `## Non-goals` | Explicitly out-of-scope outcomes; the boundary of intent. | Mandatory; an empty boundary is a defect. |
| `## Success metrics` | Measurable signals that a goal was met. | Each metric SHOULD be expressible as a future `monitor:` proof type BECAUSE a metric that cannot be observed cannot later bind a `VERIFY BY` (§proof types). |
| `## Release constraints` | Date, rollout, compliance, or dependency limits on shipping. | Constraints on *delivery*, not authored `CONSTRAINT` blocks. |
| `## Linked evidence` | References to `research.md`/`finding.md` that ground the intent. | Cross-file refs use `<spec-id>#<local-id>` where an evidence item has a local id. |

```markdown

# PRD: {{title}}

## Problem

not how to fix it.

## Users

##### 21.10.2 `rfc.md` — technical proposal

An RFC records **one technical proposal** put forward for a decision: the problem it solves, the proposed approach, the alternatives weighed, and the explicit decision being requested. Its stance is **proposal/pre-decision**: it advocates an approach but commits to none until the requested decision is made, at which point it promotes to an accepted `adr.md` (the immutable decision) and/or an approved `spec.swarm.md` (the behavioral contract) via the author pass. It is required when a technical approach is significant enough that a record of *why this and not the alternatives* must outlive the change. Every unresolved item in `## Open questions` is a `QUESTION` (`Q-NNN`) candidate and MUST remain open until resolved (§blocking-question handling); an RFC MUST NOT be promoted while a question that blocks its proposal is unresolved. A conformant `rfc.md` MUST contain:

| Section | Meaning | Stance rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| frontmatter | `type: rfc`, `id`, `status` (`proposed \| accepted \| rejected \| superseded`), `created`, `updated`. | — |
| `## Problem` | What technical problem forces a proposal. | Cite the originating `prd.md`/`finding.md`/`audit.md` where one exists. |
| `## Proposal` | The advocated approach, in enough detail to evaluate. | Describes a mechanism; authors no obligation blocks. |
| `## Alternatives` | Other approaches and why each is weaker. | Mandatory; "none considered" is a defect BECAUSE an RFC's value is the comparison it records. |
| `## Migration plan` | How adoption proceeds from the present state. | Steps and ordering, not authored `TRACE` blocks. |
| `## Open questions` | Unresolved points that gate the decision. | Each is a `QUESTION` (`Q-NNN`) candidate until resolved. |
| `## Decision requested` | The exact decision being asked for. | Names the promotion target (`adr.md` and/or `spec.swarm.md`). |

```markdown

# RFC: {{title}}

## Problem

The technical problem that forces a proposal. Cite the originating PRD, finding,
or audit where one exists.

## Proposal

The advocated approach, in enough detail to evaluate. Describes a mechanism;
authors no obligation blocks.

## Alternatives

| Alternative | Why weaker than the proposal |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| | |

## Migration plan

1. Step / ordering from the present state to the proposed state.

## Open questions

- Each unresolved point is a QUESTION (Q-NNN) candidate until resolved; an RFC
 with a blocking open question MUST NOT be promoted.

## Decision requested

The exact decision being asked for, and its promotion target
(accepted adr.md and/or approved spec.swarm.md).
```

##### 21.10.3 Stance and promotion summary

Both templates obey the same no-obligation discipline as the §21.9 set: neither `prd.md` nor `rfc.md` MAY contain `REQ`/`CONSTRAINT`/`INVARIANT`/`INTERFACE` blocks, because doing so would let an *intent* or a *proposal* be read as an approved contract and bypass the author pass (§24 source-authority). Obligations come into existence only when these source docs promote forward:

| Template | Stance | Promotes to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prd.md` | Intent-only (states the wanted outcome and why; authors no obligations). | A `spec.swarm.md` via the author pass; `## Success metrics` seed future `monitor:` proofs. |
| `rfc.md` | Proposal / pre-decision (advocates one approach, commits to none). | An accepted `adr.md` and/or approved `spec.swarm.md` via the author pass once `## Decision requested` is answered. |
