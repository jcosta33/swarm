# Example spec

A minimal `*.swarm.md` to copy. Prose explains; the **SOL blocks** carry the load-bearing requirements an
agent must satisfy. Delete this file once you have a real spec.

## Intent

Show the shape of a spec: an intent, a couple of obligations, and how each binds to a proof.

## Obligations

REQ AC-001:
WHEN a user submits the contact form with a valid email
THE service MUST persist the message and return a 201
VERIFY BY test:cmdTest:contact_form.submit_valid

REQ AC-002:
IF the email is missing or malformed
THEN THE service MUST reject the submission with a 422 and not persist anything
VERIFY BY test:cmdTest:contact_form.reject_invalid

## Constraints

CONSTRAINT C-001:
THE service MUST NOT store the raw message body in logs
VERIFY BY static:cmdLint:no-pii-in-logs

## Verification coverage

Every obligation above binds a `VERIFY BY`; the `<adapter>` slots (`cmdTest`, `cmdLint`) resolve through the
consuming repo's `AGENTS.md > Commands` table.
