# AGENTS.md

<!--
  Swarm bootloader. This is the ALWAYS-LOADED file every task reads first.
  Copy it to your project ROOT and fill the {{placeholders}}. Keep it FACTS-ONLY.

  HARD CAP: MUST stay <= 200 lines / 25 KB; SHOULD target ~50-150 lines.
  A conformant repo MUST have a regression check that fails when this file exceeds the cap.

  WHAT BELONGS HERE: persistent facts the model cannot infer, the Commands
  contract, one-line POINTERS into memory and the language reference, and a small set of
  universal startup + "do not" rules.

  WHAT MUST STAY OUT: pass procedures and how-to-review/audit/migrate steps (those live in the
  self-contained skills installed beside your own skills, loaded on demand) and full memory content.
  The SOL/APS manual and the pass reference are NOT installed — they live in the Swarm project; this
  file names them, never inlines them.
-->

## Swarm startup
<!-- The always-on doctrine (the load-what-the-task-names rule, plus the universal invariants).
     Keep these as facts/rules, never step-by-step procedures. -->
1. Read the current task file first.
2. `.agents/` holds only Swarm tooling: `skills/` (beside your own), `reference/`, `templates/`, `memory/`. Your **specs and intent artifacts live top-level as content** — `specs/*.swarm.md`, plus `adrs/`/`audits/`/`findings/`/PRDs/RFCs wherever you keep docs (identified by `type:` frontmatter). No `.swarm/` mount.
3. Treat `.swarm.md` blocks as authoritative over prose summaries.
4. Use assigned obligation IDs as scope.
5. Decide isolation before editing (see the `implement` pass): a code task with a source spec/audit runs in a `worktree+branch` named for the spec, off the base — never on it; a bare ad-hoc edit stays `in-place`.
6. Load only the pass / profile / context files the task names.
7. Map every completion claim to evidence.
8. Promote durable discoveries before closing.

## Universal rules
<!-- The universal "do not" invariants. Conditional / task-kind-specific rules go in
     task templates or profiles, not here. -->
- Do not implement behavior outside assigned obligations.
- Do not treat chat as higher authority than an approved spec or ADR.
- Do not close a task with unhandled promotion items.
- Do not claim completion without evidence.

## Project facts
<!-- Persistent facts an agent cannot infer: stack, conventions, boundaries the project relies on.
     One bullet per fact. Delete this section if the project has none worth stating. -->
- {{persistent-fact-the-model-cannot-infer}}
- {{persistent-fact-the-model-cannot-infer}}

## Pointers
<!-- One-line pointers ONLY — never inline the target content. -->
- Skills (the authoring kit: 6 source-author guides, the `lint`/`improve`/`lower`/`decompose`/`review`/`promote` pass guides, 6 authoring `persona-*` stances, 2 fragments): your skills dir (e.g. `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`), beside your own. Each carries its pass *procedure* inline. (Code-implementation skills aren't here — they're Swarm-project reference.)
- Operative reference cards (the shared closed-set rules every pass needs — SOL grammar, proofs/verdicts/adequacy, the IR/edges): `.agents/reference/` (`sol.md`, `proofs.md`, `ir.md`). Load the card for the pass you're running.
- Specs + intent: `specs/` (source `*.swarm.md`, top-level), plus `adrs/`/`audits/`/`findings/` as content. Durable recall: `.agents/memory/` (`INDEX.md` is the load-*when* map).
- Project conventions (architecture boundaries, extra refusals, command bindings): in this file — see `## Project facts` and `## Commands` below.
- The **full** SOL/APS/passes manuals (rationale, worked examples) are **not installed** — they live in the Swarm project (`docs/`); the shipped cards carry the operative rules, the manuals carry the *why*.

## Compatibility
Swarm's skills install **directly into the dir your CLI scans** (`.claude/skills/` for Claude Code, or the
neutral `.agents/skills/`), beside your own skills — there is no separate home and no symlink bridge. Their
names (`pass-*`, `persona-*`, `write-*`) don't collide with yours, so an upgrade just re-copies them and
leaves your skills untouched. The reference cards sit in `.agents/reference/`.

## Commands
<!--
  The Commands contract. This is a FACT (a binding), which is why a table is allowed
  in an otherwise facts-only file. Each `cmd*` slot is the adapter a
  `VERIFY BY <type>:<adapter>:<artifact>` clause resolves through (the `verify` pass; full reference in the Swarm project).

  NORMATIVE:
  - Populate a `cmd*` row for EVERY proof type any `VERIFY BY` clause in this repo references.
    An unresolved adapter is a verification-layer lint defect (SOL-V002) and a BLOCKED verdict
    at the gate; a missing required `cmd*` row is a negative conformance-fixture class.
  - This is SOFT CONTROL: the table names what a future launcher WOULD run. Nothing here
    is executed, and this file MUST NOT claim it enforces or runs these commands.

  Fill the Command column; add or remove rows to match the proof types this repo actually uses.
