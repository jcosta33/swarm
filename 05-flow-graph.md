# The flow graph

The deterministic mapping between documents, tasks, and personas. This is the
core of the framework's auto-conditioning: pick a source document and the
task type, the persona, the skills, and the verification commands all follow.

This document is reference material — agents consult it when deciding what
to do, but the rules themselves are enforced by the launcher (Swarm CLI or
equivalent), the task templates, and the `documentation-gatekeeper` skill.

For the personas referenced here, see `.agents/skills/personas/SKILL.md`.
For the documentation tiers, see `01-process.md`. For document types and
their structure, see `02-file-types.md`.

## The pipeline

```
┌──────────────────┐
│  Source document │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐    Determined by document type:
│    Task type     │    audit → refactor, spec → feature, etc.
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐    Determined by task type:
│     Persona      │    refactor → Janitor, feature → Builder, etc.
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐    Skills + verification commands attached.
│  Conditioned     │    Worktree + branch created. Agent CLI launches.
│   task.md        │
└──────────────────┘
```

Information flows in one direction along the verbosity gradient: high-level
to low-level, never back.

```
research.md  ──▶  spec.md       ──▶  task.md   (feature)
research.md  ──▶  audit.md      ──▶  task.md   (refactor)
research.md  ──▶  bug-report.md ──▶  task.md   (fix)

research.md is OPTIONAL — only when training data is insufficient
```

Task files are terminal. They never feed another doc; durable findings are
promoted to audits, specs, or research before the session closes.

---

## Document → task type

Every document the human (or an upstream agent) hands to Swarm has exactly
one default task type. The user can override at session start, but the
default is deterministic.

| Source document | Default task type | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `spec.md` | feature | The spec describes a new capability to build |
| `audit.md` | refactor | The audit identifies cleanup work to do |
| `bug-report.md` | fix | The report describes a defect to repair |
| `research.md` (technical) | spec-writing | Research is upstream input; the next step is translating into a spec |
| `research.md` (UX/market) | spec-writing | Same — translate findings into requirements |
| _none — initial human ask_ | research-writing / spec-writing / audit-writing / bug-report-writing | A "blank slate" ask kicks off an authoring task; which one depends on the prompt |
| _another agent's branch_ | review | Lead Engineer or Skeptic reviewing finished work |
| _multiple source docs (e.g. 5 specs)_ | orchestration | Lead Engineer decomposes and delegates |
| _existing audit + new investigation request_ | deepen-audit | Skeptic re-walks an existing audit |

### Edges that look possible but aren't

- **research → fix** — forbidden. Research must go through a spec or audit before becoming actionable. Implementing directly from research means skipping the stage whose job is to translate.
- **spec → refactor** — uncommon. Refactor tasks are driven by audits. If a spec calls for restructuring, the spec is implicitly the refactor's plan, but the task is still tracked as a feature unless the change is purely structural.
- **bug-report → refactor** — forbidden. A bug report drives a fix, not a cleanup. If fixing the bug reveals broader cleanup needs, surface them as findings; do not expand scope silently.
- **audit → feature** — forbidden. Audits do not specify new features; they describe current state and recommend cleanup. If the audit's recommended approach is "build something new", the next step is a spec, not a feature task.

---

## Task type → persona

Each task type has a primary persona that is auto-attached. Some have
secondary personas for handoff (e.g. a feature task ends with a Skeptic
review; a refactor task ends the same way).

| Task type | Primary persona | Secondary (handoff) |
|---|---|---|
| feature | The Builder | The Skeptic (review) |
| fix | The Skeptic | — (the framework's existing convention is that fix sessions adopt the Skeptic mindset because root-causing demands hostility) |
| refactor | The Janitor | The Skeptic (review) |
| rewrite | The Builder | The Skeptic (review) |
| spec-writing | The Architect | — |
| research-writing (technical) | The Researcher | — |
| research-writing (UX/market) | The Surveyor | — |
| audit-writing | The Auditor | — |
| bug-report-writing | The Bug Hunter | — |
| migration | The Migrator | The Skeptic (review of each wave) |
| performance | The Performance Surgeon | The Skeptic (review) |
| testing | The Test Author | The Skeptic (review) |
| documentation | The Documentarian | The Skeptic (review) |
| review | The Skeptic | — |
| deepen-audit | The Skeptic | — |
| orchestration | The Lead Engineer | The Skeptic (the merge-gate review pass adopts this stance) |
| integration | The Builder | The Skeptic (review) |
| upgrade | The Migrator | The Skeptic (review of each wave) |
| kickback | The Builder (or whichever persona produced the original work) | The Skeptic (re-review after fix) |

`swarm.config` may override the primary persona for any task type. The most
common override: routing fix tasks to a dedicated Fixer persona instead of
the Skeptic, when a team prefers minimality-focus over adversarial-focus.

---

## Task type → skills attached

Every task type loads `manage-task` and `documentation-gatekeeper` by default
(per the framework's standing convention). The table below lists the
*additional* skills the task type loads.

| Task type | Additional skills |
|---|---|
| feature | `write-feature`, `empirical-proof` |
| fix | `write-fix`, `adversarial-review`, `empirical-proof` |
| refactor | `write-refactor`, `empirical-proof` |
| rewrite | `write-rewrite`, `empirical-proof` |
| spec-writing | `write-spec`, `distillation-discipline` |
| research-writing | `write-research`, `distillation-discipline` |
| audit-writing | `write-audit`, `adversarial-review` |
| bug-report-writing | `write-bug-report`, `adversarial-review`, `empirical-proof` |
| migration | `write-refactor` (overlaps), `empirical-proof` |
| performance | `empirical-proof` |
| testing | `empirical-proof` |
| documentation | `distillation-discipline`, `empirical-proof` |
| review | `adversarial-review`, `empirical-proof` |
| deepen-audit | `write-audit`, `adversarial-review`, `empirical-proof` |
| orchestration | `adversarial-review`, `empirical-proof` |

Project-specific skills (architecture-violations, testing-file-layout, etc.)
attach in addition based on `swarm.config.alwaysAttachSkills` and on
descriptions matching the task domain.

---

## Task type → verification commands

Each task type fires verification commands at specific phases. The commands
themselves come from `swarm.config`; the table below shows *when* they fire.

| Task type | Pre-implementation | Periodic | Post-implementation | Self-review |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| feature | `cmdInstall` | `cmdValidate` after each batch | `cmdValidate`, `cmdTest` | All above |
| fix | `cmdInstall` | — | `cmdValidate`, `cmdTest` | + `git diff --stat` |
| refactor | `cmdInstall` | `cmdValidateDeps` every 10 files | `cmdValidateDeps`, `cmdTypecheck` | All above |
| rewrite | `cmdInstall` | `cmdValidate` after each module | `cmdValidate`, `cmdTest` | All above |
| spec-writing | — | — | `git status` (must be clean on source) | + `git status` |
| research-writing | — | — | `git status` | + `git status` |
| audit-writing | — | — | `git status` | + `git status` |
| bug-report-writing | — | — | `git status` (the reproduction proof is its own verification) | + reproduction output |
| migration | `cmdInstall` | `cmdValidate` after each wave | `cmdValidate`, `cmdTest` | All above |
| performance | `cmdInstall`, baseline `cmdBenchmark` | `cmdTest` after each change | target `cmdBenchmark`, `cmdTest` | All above |
| testing | `cmdInstall` | `cmdTest` after each new test | `cmdTest`, coverage report | All above |
| documentation | — | — | run any code examples | + example output |
| review | `cmdInstall` | — | `cmdValidate`, `cmdTest` (run yourself, not trusting the worker) | + `git diff` of branch under review |
| orchestration | `cmdInstall` | per-worker review pass | merged-branch `cmdValidate`, `cmdTest` | + per-worker review log |

---

## Recursion

A task can spawn sub-tasks. The conditioning pipeline runs recursively at
each level, with no special cases — each sub-task is itself a (source doc,
task type, persona) triple.

The most common recursion is the Lead Engineer pattern:

```
human → orchestration task (Lead Engineer)
            │
            ├── feature task (Builder, on spec A)
            ├── feature task (Builder, on spec B)
            ├── refactor task (Janitor, on audit C)
            └── feature task (Builder, on spec D)
```

Each child task gets its own worktree, branch, conditioned task file, and
agent CLI session. The Lead Engineer's task file tracks all children — slug,
branch, status, last review verdict.

`swarm.config` sets the recursion limit. Default: 2 (a Lead Engineer may
spawn workers, and those workers are not themselves Lead Engineers). Higher
limits permit Lead-Engineer-of-Lead-Engineers patterns; raise carefully.

---

## Kickback

When the Skeptic rejects a worker's branch, the rejection itself becomes a
conditioned task. The kickback is a (source doc + skeptic notes) → fix task
triple. The original worker (or a fresh agent in the same persona) takes
the kickback notes as additional input.

```
Builder finishes feature task
         │
         ▼
Skeptic reviews (review task)
         │
   ┌─────┴─────┐
   │           │
 PASS       FAIL → kickback task
                       │ (source: original spec + skeptic notes)
                       │ (task type: feature kickback)
                       │ (persona: Builder)
                       ▼
                   Builder revises
                       │
                       ▼
                Skeptic reviews again
```

A kickback is a normal task with normal conditioning. The only special
input is the Skeptic's notes — they ride alongside the original spec in
`## Linked docs`.

---

## Edge cases

**Ambiguous source document.** If a doc is unclear — a research file that's
really an audit, a spec that contains too much current-state — the
launcher should ask the human to confirm the doc type rather than guess.
The framework strongly prefers explicit reclassification over silent
re-routing.

**No source document.** A "blank slate" ask kicks off an authoring task.
The launcher selects the authoring type from the human's prompt — "research
X", "audit Y", "spec Z", "find the bug in W" — or asks if it cannot tell.

**Multiple source docs.** A task may legitimately have multiple sources
(spec + research, audit + research, original spec + skeptic notes for a
kickback). All sources go in `## Linked docs`. The task type follows the
*primary* source's routing rule.

**No research, no spec.** Trivial tasks may skip the docs entirely — see
`01-process.md` on what counts as trivial. For non-trivial work, document
the skip in the task file's `## Decisions` with the reason.

**Research that's sufficient without a spec.** Forbidden. If you find
yourself implementing directly from research, stop and write the spec
first. Research is input; spec is contract. The framework treats this as
a hard rule because the failure mode (drift between research findings and
implementation) is severe and silent.

## Decision flow when starting a task

```
Does a source document exist?
├── No → authoring task
│         │
│         └── Which authoring type matches the human's ask?
│             ├── "research X"      → research-writing
│             ├── "audit Y"         → audit-writing
│             ├── "spec Z"          → spec-writing
│             └── "find bug W"      → bug-report-writing
│
└── Yes → look up the source doc type in "Document → task type" above
              │
              └── Route to the default task type
                       │
                       └── Look up persona in "Task type → persona"
                                │
                                └── Attach skills, inject commands, scaffold task file
```

The launcher does this. The agent does not need to think about it — the
agent reads the conditioned task file and adopts the persona named in the
`> **PERSONA:**` blockquote.
