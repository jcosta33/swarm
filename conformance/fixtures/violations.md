# Conformance violations — expected-FAIL fixtures

One minimal example per violation class. Each must make a checker return **non-conformant**,
citing the named rule from `./conformance.yaml`. This is the checker's regression suite: if a
checker passes any of these, the checker (or the manifest) is wrong.

## V1 — empty paste slot (`content_rules: non-empty-paste`)

```markdown
## Verification matrix

- `{{cmdValidate}}` (last 2 lines):
- `{{cmdTest}}` (last 2 lines):
```

**Expected:** FAIL — required paste slots are bare placeholders (no fenced output, no `n/a` + reason). This is the hallucinated-completion hole the gate exists to surface.

---

## V2 — missing required section (`task_file.required_sections`)

A task file presenting `## Parent contract`, `## Scope`, `## Assigned obligations`, `## Constraints and invariants`, `## Implementation or pass trace`, `## Promotion queue`, and `## Self-review` — but **no `## Verification matrix`**.

**Expected:** FAIL — `Verification matrix` is a member of the manifest's closed `required_sections` set; a task missing it cannot carry the proof side of any obligation.

---

## V3 — missing required `Commands` row (`agents_md.required_command_rows`)

An `AGENTS.md > Commands` table binding `Validation` and `Test` but **omitting `Format`**.

**Expected:** FAIL — `Format` is a required command row; skills that close a session by formatting have nothing to resolve.

---

## V4 — illegal placeholder namespace (`placeholders.rule`)

A template introducing `{{cmdFrobnicate}}` — a new `cmd*` slot absent from the catalogue and introduced without an ADR.

**Expected:** FAIL — the `cmd*` namespace is reserved; new slots require an ADR. (A vendor extension would be `{{vendor:frobnicate}}`, which is legal.)

---

## V5 — unresolved blocking `QUESTION` at close (`content_rules: no-open-critical`)

```sol
QUESTION Q-001 [blocking]:
Which auth scheme — resolve before implementing?
AFFECTS AC-001
```

…in a task file whose frontmatter `status` is the terminal value `done`.

**Expected:** FAIL — an unresolved `[blocking]` `QUESTION` remains in a task whose `status` is `done`; `done` is terminal and MUST NOT carry an open blocking decision.

---

## V6 — required-suite slot missing for the task type (`required_suite`)

A `refactor` task whose `### Verification outputs` pastes `{{cmdTest}}` but has **no `behaviour-preservation` evidence and no `{{cmdValidateDeps}}` checkpoint**.

**Expected:** FAIL — the `refactor` required suite includes `ValidateDeps`, `Typecheck`, `Test`, and `behaviour-preservation`; a green test suite alone is not equivalence proof.
