<!--
checkout golden-corpus fixture — Stage 6 (trace, pass: verify).
The `verify` pass records a TRACE block per work packet plus the provenance the drift join
depends on — the canonical seven fields: source_hash (echoing the IR node content_hash),
per_surface_hash[] (each entry {surface, hash, exercised}), adapter, verdict, tier (the PROOF
TYPE, never a RISK value), origin_obligations[], origin_traces[]. T-010 covers the submit
packet; T-011 covers the serialized inventory packet. Inert oracle data; the proof results
below are recorded, not executed here.
