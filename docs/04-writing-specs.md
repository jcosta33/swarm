# Writing specs

*Works today — plain markdown plus your agent; no Corpus tooling required.*

A spec is one markdown file. Before any code is written, it answers: **what should the system
do, for whom, how will we know it works, and what is deliberately out of scope?** It is the
contract between whoever wants the change and whoever — or whatever — builds it. An agent works
from it without coming back to ask. A reviewer checks the result against it row by row.

A spec is **not** a task — that's the bounded work packet cut from it (see
[Creating tasks](06-creating-tasks.md)). Nor is it a design brainstorm, a change plan, a PR
description, an audit, or a bug report. It records intended behavior; how the code gets there is
the implementer's call.

## When to write one — and when not

Write a spec when behavior changes: a user-visible feature, an API or business-rule change,
anything where two people (or one person and one agent) must agree on acceptance criteria, or a
bug that revealed missing expected behavior worth pinning down.

Skip the spec for:

- a trivial rename,
- formatting-only changes,
- a one-liner already covered by an existing requirement,
- routine housekeeping with no behavior change.

Those go straight to a small task; the [basic workflow](02-basic-workflow.md) page has the
skip-paths. The threshold is a convention — nothing in this repo enforces it. But it is not
politeness. Forcing clarification onto already-clear work measurably hurts outcomes, and extending
that to documents is this framework's design judgment
[[HUMANEVALCOMM]](research/sources.md#HUMANEVALCOMM)
[[ASKORASSUME]](research/sources.md#ASKORASSUME).

**Right-size the artifact, too.** A bounded fix or polish against behavior an existing spec already
covers is a **bug report** (the kit's `advanced/bug.md`: reproduction + root cause) feeding a fix
task — not a new feature spec. Reach for a fresh spec only when the behavior is new or changing.

**The one-line test: does anyone have to _agree_ on the acceptance criteria before the work
starts?** If a reviewer or second party must sign off on *what counts as done*, write the spec.
That agreement is what a spec is for. If the ACs are self-evident and only the implementer needs
them — a small, well-understood net-new change — write a **thin task** instead that inlines its two
or three ACs with their `Verify with:` lines. The work is still reviewed, against the task's own
ACs. The trade is deliberate: a thin task has no separate spec for `swarm check` to reconcile
coverage against. So keep the spec the moment that coverage check earns its keep — a wider change,
an unfamiliar area, or a reviewer who wants the row-by-row table.

## The template

The format is frozen in the kit. Copy
[`templates/spec.md`](https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm-starter-kit/blob/main/templates/spec.md) rather than reinventing it.
What each part is for:

- **Frontmatter** — `type: spec`, an `id` (`SPEC-<slug>`), `title`, `status` (`draft` until the
  open questions are answered, then `ready`), an `owner` (who answers questions during the work),
  `sources` (the ticket or intake file this spec distills).
- **Intent** — one to three sentences: the behavior change and why.
- **Non-goals** — what this spec deliberately does not change.
- **Requirements** — one `### AC-NNN — <name>` each: a single behavior sentence
  ("When X, the component must Y.") and a `Verify with:` line naming a test or command.
- **Open questions** — anything unresolved. One keeps the spec out of `status: ready` unless marked "(non-blocking)" (the SOL form uses a `[blocking|non-blocking]` tag for the same choice).
- **Affected areas** — the paths the work is expected to touch.
- A spec is a one-page contract — aim for ~100 lines. Past that, you are usually writing
  two specs (a budget convention, not a rule).
- **Dropped from sources** — optional, recommended: what the ticket or PRD asked for that this
  spec leaves out, and why.

## Writing rules

All advisory. They make requirements checkable and let a reviewer inspect each one, but nothing
blocks you. The full list of common mistakes lives in
[`reference/checks.md`](reference/checks.md). The optional reference CLI's `swarm check` flags the
toolable ones; the rest stay review checklist items.

1. **Give every requirement a `Verify with:` line.** It is the highest-value line in the file: a
   runnable check outperforms prose plans as task input (preliminary evidence)
   [[ORACLESWE]](research/sources.md#ORACLESWE). Naming a test that doesn't exist yet is fine — the
   review result reads Unverified until it does. A check over stochastic output (an eval metric, a
   benchmark, an LLM behavior) pins its protocol on the same line: same seed or fixed dataset, the
   metric, the threshold. Otherwise two honest runs disagree about the same code. Where no command
   can run it, name the method: `manual` (a recorded human observation — who judged, what they saw)
   or `monitor` (a post-merge signal). The [verification methods](reference/glossary.md) list the kinds.
2. **Use observable verbs.** "Returns 401", "redirects to `/login`", "writes the audit row" —
   not "handles", "supports", "manages", "improves".
3. **One behavior per requirement.** If the sentence needs an "and", it is usually two
   requirements — split them so each passes or fails on its own.
4. **Name the actor.** "The client must…", "The API must…" — never "it should" or a passive
   "errors are logged" that leaves the doer unknown.
5. **One binding word per requirement** — must, must not, should, should not, or may — and mean it.
   A "should" hands the agent a decision, so make sure that's intended.
6. **Order requirements by importance.** Agents weight earlier instructions more — put the
   requirement you would block the merge over first.
7. **Lift uncertainty into Open questions.** A hedge inside a requirement ("probably", "if
   feasible") buries a decision; a listed question gets answered before `ready`.
8. **Watch the vague words.** _Fast, robust, scalable, secure, gracefully, significant, as
   needed_ — fine with a same-sentence number or observable behavior, a smell without one. The
   watchlist is advisory, never a gate.
9. **Keep Non-goals honest.** List what a reasonable reader might assume is included but isn't —
   Non-goals are where scope disputes settle cheaply.
10. **Celebrate "Dropped from sources".** What you cut, and why, is where design rationale lives —
    the next person sees the decision instead of re-litigating it.
11. **Research the platform's limits before the ACs.** For work against an external platform —
    quota, permissions, rate limits, runtime or sandbox constraints — find the binding limits
    *first*. Lift an unknown one into **Open questions** (it keeps the spec out of `ready`). Bind a
    known one as a requirement with a `Verify with:` line. Record a deliberately-unhandled one as a
    **Non-goal**. Hitting a quota wall *after* the ACs are written is the expensive path. (Proving
    it works against the real platform at review is the runtime-proof rule in
    [Reviewing output](08-reviewing-output.md), per [ADR-0076](adrs/0076-worker-provenance-and-adoption-conventions.md).)

## Why this much care

These rules are not style preferences. Ambiguous or incomplete requirement text measurably
degrades agent code correctness [[ORCHID]](research/sources.md#ORCHID)
[[HUMANEVALCOMM]](research/sources.md#HUMANEVALCOMM). Models usually code anyway instead of
asking [[HUMANEVALCOMM]](research/sources.md#HUMANEVALCOMM) [[HILBENCH]](research/sources.md#HILBENCH), so the misreading lands in the diff, not a
clarifying question. The fix is in the text. Clarifying or repairing the requirement recovers
correctness, and the repaired text transfers across models
[[SPECFIX]](research/sources.md#SPECFIX) [[CLARIFYGPT]](research/sources.md#CLARIFYGPT). Terse,
chat-style task input also costs agents a large share of measured benchmark performance
[[SWEMUT]](research/sources.md#SWEMUT) (preliminary). Half an hour on the spec beats a review cycle
on the wrong implementation.

## When the spec changes

Amend in place. Review feedback, a discovered edge case, a change of direction — edit the
requirement and keep its ID. A renumbered AC silently breaks every task scope, review row, and
finding that references it. Record any material cut under Dropped from sources. New behavior gets
new IDs; retired requirements keep their ID with a one-line note rather than freeing the number. No
regeneration step, no version field — git history is the history. A spec known to lag the code is
marked `stale` on the status board until someone amends it
(see [Where files live](03-where-files-live.md)).

## Stricter notation: SOL

For high-risk work, any spec can switch its requirements to SOL, a stricter structured
requirements notation, by adding `format: sol` to the frontmatter. Same requirement, two surfaces:

```markdown
### AC-001 — Expired refresh token redirects to login

When the refresh token is expired, the client must clear the local
session and redirect to `/login`.

Verify with: `auth-refresh-expired-token.test`
```

```text
REQ AC-001:
WHEN the refresh token is expired
THE client MUST clear the local session
AND THE client MUST redirect to `/login`
VERIFY BY test:cmdTest:auth-refresh-expired-token
```

The IDs, the binding words, and the verification line carry over one-for-one, and review reads
both forms identically. SOL just fixes the clause order and makes the binding explicit. Notation
reference: [`reference/structured-requirements.md`](reference/structured-requirements.md).
