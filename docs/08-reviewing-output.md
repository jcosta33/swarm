# Reviewing agent output

*Works today — plain markdown plus your agent; no Corpus tooling required.*

Review is the step Corpus exists for. Coding agents produce more code than anyone can read line by
line. The review packet turns that volume into a short list a human must actually look at.

## Review by exception

An agent run can hand you a 3000-line diff. Reading it top to bottom is not review. It is skimming
with extra guilt. Review by exception inverts it:

- read **which requirements passed, with what evidence**,
- read **which did not** (failed, unverified, or blocked),
- read **the exceptions** — the short list of places the packet says your eyes are needed.

You still open the diff, but where the packet points, not at line 1. A passing result with real
evidence is already accounted for. Your attention goes to what the structure flags.

## What review is for

Most of what review catches is not broken behavior. About **three-quarters of the defects found in
code review do not affect visible functionality** — they are *evolvability* defects (structure,
readability, documentation) that tests and CI are blind to
[[MANTYLA09]](research/sources.md#MANTYLA09). In modern review, defect comments are a minority while
code-improvement comments dominate [[BACCHELLI13]](research/sources.md#BACCHELLI13). So review is
**complementary to tests, not a slower substitute**. CI owns functional regressions; review owns the
maintainability and design layer no suite can see. That is why a human is still required for
substantial changes. Treat evolvability findings — a confusing name, a leaky boundary, an
undocumented contract — as first-class review output, not an afterthought to "did it pass."
(Convention; [ADR-0095](adrs/0095-review-model-grounding.md).)

## The review packet

The packet is one markdown file in `reviews/`, one per task, named after the task's slug. The format is frozen in the kit
template — [`templates/review.md`](https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm-starter-kit/blob/main/templates/review.md) — with a
filled example in [`examples/`](examples/). Walking through it:

- **Summary** — two or three sentences: what changed, what is verified, what is not.
- **Changed files** — the touched paths, so out-of-scope edits show at a glance.
- **Requirement coverage** — the heart of the packet. One row per requirement in the task's
  scope: `ID | Result | Evidence | Human attention`. The evidence cell holds pasted command
  output or a CI link (manual method: the named human's recorded observation), not a sentence
  about output. Read the task packet's Run summary first. It indexes the Verify pastes the cells
  cite.
- **Change-plan coverage** — only when the task executes a change plan (see below).
- **Human attention** — the exception list: each item, why it matters, a suggested action.
- **Suggested decision** — merge, or block until a named item is resolved.

A packet should fit on one page. If it doesn't, the task was probably too big. That's feedback for
[task splitting](06-creating-tasks.md), not a reason to write a longer packet.

(`swarm review` drafts this packet. It reconciles the finished run against the diff and the spec
and surfaces the facts. The result is still decided by you, or a fresh agent session that did not
write the diff.)

## Review packet invariants

Every non-trivial agent run ends in a review packet before it counts review-ready. A sound packet
holds five invariants — a checklist before you trust one:

- [ ] **One row per scoped requirement.** Every requirement (and preservation guarantee) in the
  task's scope has exactly one coverage row. An in-scope id with no row can neither pass nor route
  to a human.
- [ ] **Empty evidence means Unverified, never Pass.** A Pass needs pasted output, a CI link, or a
  named human's recorded observation. A blank Evidence cell reads Unverified whatever the prose says.
- [ ] **Out-of-scope edits become Human-attention rows.** A changed file outside the task's Affected
  areas is surfaced, not merged quietly.
- [ ] **The implementer never issues its own result.** Whoever wrote the diff does not fill the
  result. A fresh agent session or a human does. Self-review yields fixes, never a result.
- [ ] **The packet is the durable record.** The PR or comment may summarize it, but the packet — not
  the PR thread — survives as the record of what was verified against the spec.

These are checklist-level (a reviewer inspects them) and toolable. `swarm check` flags the
mechanical ones — empty evidence, coverage, out-of-scope edits. `swarm review` drafts the packet
and reconciles it against the diff. Nothing in this repo enforces them.

## The evidence rules

Checklist-level: nothing in this repo enforces them. The reviewer inspects them, and they are on
the review checks in [`reference/checks.md`](reference/checks.md).

1. **A Pass needs pasted output, a CI link, or — for a manual Verify method — a named
   human's recorded observation (who judged, what they saw).** A bare "tests passed" is a
   claim, not evidence. Unsupported done-claims are the failure this rule catches, illustrated
   (small-N, preliminary) by [[EVIBOUND]](research/sources.md#EVIBOUND).
2. **An empty Evidence cell means Unverified, never Pass.** If nobody can point at the
   output, the requirement was not verified, whatever the prose says.
3. **Don't merge with an open critical item.** A failed or blocked requirement, or an
   unanswered blocking question, holds the merge until resolved or explicitly waived by a
   human. A waiver is a record — who waived · which rows · why · expiry. The packet's
   status becomes `waived` at merge; the row's Result stays what the evidence says.
4. **A known-flaky check cannot buy a Pass with one green run.** Reproduce per the
   fix-flaky-test discipline (loop it) before the row reads Pass.
5. **Separate an environment baseline from a feature regression.** A check that fails for
   reasons outside this change's scope — a broken build script, a missing toolchain, an
   environment that can't run the check — is **Blocked**, not Fail (the full Blocked-vs-Fail
   distinction is in [the advanced lifecycle](reference/advanced-lifecycle.md)). Record such a
   baseline blocker **once**, not as a Fail on every requirement row it touches. A check that
   actually ran and got wrong behavior is a feature-regression **Fail**. A check that passes only
   on a **labeled alternate/diagnostic runtime** (e.g. a bundled browser when the target
   environment is Blocked) is recorded as *diagnostic evidence*. The target-environment
   requirement stays Blocked until it runs there.
6. **API, DOM, or platform behavior wants proof from the real runtime.** A green unit test against
   a mock is a claim about the mock. The requirement is met only when the actual call, render, or
   permission is observed. Name the runtime the evidence came from — the live endpoint, a real
   browser, the target OS — so a Pass on integration-shaped work can't rest on a stubbed one.
7. **An agent that runs the app produces evidence, not a verdict.** Driving the live app to exercise
   a behavior is a distinct, valuable verifier — an LLM agent found 53 real bugs (35 fixed) this way
   [[GPTDROID]](research/sources.md#GPTDROID). But agents driving live UIs are unreliable (the best
   reach ~61%, most ~30% [[WEBAGENTILLUSION]](research/sources.md#WEBAGENTILLUSION)), so an autonomous
   run never *certifies* a change. The author-agent **attaches its run** (accessibility snapshot,
   console, network) as the Evidence; an **independent reviewer re-runs the journey and judges**. The
   no-self-result rule applies to app-runs too. Prefer deterministic accessibility-tree tooling
   (Playwright-MCP style: structured data, "no vision models needed")
   [[PLAYWRIGHTMCP]](research/sources.md#PLAYWRIGHTMCP) over pixel/vision, the flakier layer.

A coverage row may also carry its evidence in structured form: an optional fenced `verify` block, beside the row and keyed to the requirement id, naming the command and a pass signal. It is a machine-checkable form of the same evidence the free-form cell points at.

````
| AC-001 | Pass | see verify block | no |

```verify id=AC-001 cmd="npm test -- auth-refresh.spec.ts" result=pass
replays-after-refresh ✓  (1 passed, 0 failed)
```
````

The info-string is the machine-readable part — the requirement id, the named command, a `pass`/`fail` signal. The fenced body below it is the verbatim paste, for you and the spot-check. The block is opt-in; a row may still use only the free-form cell.

The form is what earns a mechanical match. A `verify` block whose `cmd` matches the requirement's named `Verify with:` command, keyed to a Pass row, carrying `result=pass`, lets a tool confirm *the row records a matching named command with a pass signal* rather than only *the cell is non-empty*. A row with only the free-form cell stays a human-attention item: matching a named command to free-form prose is imprecise [[SMELLS]](research/sources.md#SMELLS), so it is read, never machine-rejected.

Either way this moves where the machine can help, not what is true. The fenced body is self-reported and unparsed, so the block does not prove the command ran, and a passing command does not by itself mean the requirement is met. The spot-check rule below still carries that weight. swarm-cli's `swarm review` / `swarm check` reconcile this today: core check **C013** confirms the block records a matching named command with `result=pass` and surfaces a mismatch as a consistency fact, never a review result. Toolable, not enforced — the canon repo runs nothing, and a team's gate decides whether to act on it.

Solo? The independence rule holds by actor: whoever produced the diff — your hands or an agent
session — does not fill the packet. Agent implements → you review; you implement → a fresh agent
session reviews. Self-review stays mandatory and yields fixes, never a result.

## Spot-check one green row

Before accepting the table, pick at least one Pass row and verify its evidence yourself: re-run
the command, or open the CI link and read the actual result. This is a convention, not something
any tool checks. Structured packets invite rubber-stamping — a tidy table
_feels_ verified. The bias is measured, not hypothetical: evaluators favor their own generations
[[SELFPREFER]](research/sources.md#SELFPREFER) and carry predictable judgment biases
[[JUDGEBIAS]](research/sources.md#JUDGEBIAS). One honest spot-check per packet keeps the green
column meaning something.

## What needs your eyes — the exception triggers

The Human attention section routes these. A good packet has considered every class — listing
an exception or having nothing to list:

- unverified or failed requirements
- out-of-scope changes (edits not traceable to the task's scope)
- integration seams — callers, schemas, events, or contracts this change touches that the task's
  own tests don't exercise (it passes in isolation; the system it plugs into may not)
- work delegated in a **shared worktree** — if an agent sub-delegated and edits were not isolated
  to one branch/checkout, treat provenance and scope as unverified until shown otherwise
- risky files (auth, payments, IAM policies, security groups, state moves, destroys —
  anything with a blast radius)
- missing test output
- changed public interfaces
- DB migrations
- security-sensitive changes
- new finding candidates (durable lessons — see [Saving findings](09-saving-findings.md))
- blocked questions

## Read like a skeptic

When a branch warrants more than the packet — high risk, large diff, low trust — the
[`adversarial-review`](https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm-starter-kit/blob/main/.agents/skills/adversarial-review/SKILL.md)
guide (shipped in the kit) runs the deep form: re-run validation yourself, walk six adversarial
questions, search the callers of everything that changed.

The reviewer's stance is refute-by-default: a claim is unproven until evidence forces you to accept
it. In practice —

- treat confident prose as a claim to check, never as proof;
- prefer output you ran or watched run over output you were handed;
- if you authored the change, you don't decide its review result. Self-review before finishing is
  good practice — the [task template](https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm-starter-kit/blob/main/templates/task.md) asks the
  agent for it — but it produces fixes, not approval.

## Who reviews — independent, distinct-lens, and engaged

- **The reviewer is not the author.** The desk-checking principle, not a measured effect: if the
  author had seen the defect they would have fixed it. An author reviewing only their own work is
  the weakest possible review [[WIEGERS95]](research/sources.md#WIEGERS95). It reinforces the
  no-self-result invariant (ADR-0056) — design rationale, not enforcement.
- **Default to two independent reviewers, each with a distinct lens; add a third for risk.** Modern
  review converged on about two reviewers, with little extra caught beyond
  [[RIGBY13]](research/sources.md#RIGBY13). Give each a distinct, skeptical aim — e.g. **correctness**,
  **maintainability + design**, **security + reproduction** — not two passes of the same read.
  Escalate to a third lens for a high-risk or high-diffusion change (the diffusion signal from
  [Brownfield & change plans](05-brownfield-and-change-plans.md)). Agent reviewers are cheap, so a
  third is easy to justify.
- **Participation is the gate, not the sign-off.** A `Pass` requires evidence of *substantive
  engagement* — a finding raised, a check re-run, a reasoned result. Lax participation, not
  thin coverage, is what predicts post-release defects (up to five extra)
  [[MCINTOSH14]](research/sources.md#MCINTOSH14). An empty-evidence `Pass` already reads `Unverified`
  (the invariant above): the participation gate in mechanical form.

Checklist level; nothing enforces reviewer count or lens assignment ([ADR-0095](adrs/0095-review-model-grounding.md)).

## Reviewing transformation work

When the task executes a change plan (refactor, migration, rewrite — see
[Brownfield and change plans](05-brownfield-and-change-plans.md)), the preservation guarantees are
rows too. The packet's **Change-plan coverage** table gives each "must still behave exactly as
before" guarantee the same `ID | Result | Evidence | Human attention` treatment as the
requirements. "Nothing broke" is a claim like any other. It needs evidence.

## When the work arrives as code

Sometimes there is no upstream artifact at all — an external PR from a stranger, a vendor patch, a
bug in code no spec covers. The loop still works, run post-hoc:

1. **Intake the code-shaped work** — snapshot the PR description and diff stats verbatim
   (`source: gh-pr`), exactly like a ticket.
2. **Write the spec as an acceptance bar** — what must be true for this change to merge, one
   `AC-NNN` per behavior, written *after* the code exists. It bounds the review, not the build.
3. **The reviewer produces all evidence.** A silent or unavailable author pastes nothing. Your own
   runs fill the Evidence column, the stronger position anyway: the worker's paste is a claim, your
   run is evidence.

The packet then reads identically to any other review. Without a task packet, the spec's
requirement ids key the coverage table directly.

## Scoring a delegated run — the self-report is a claim

When the work was delegated to a worker agent, all it hands back about *how* it ran is its `## Run
summary` (what it says it changed, the results it cites) and the **shape of the diff** (what
actually changed). That self-report is evidence to inspect, never a trust token. A worker can claim
a green result it never produced, or boot from a stale packet and report against the wrong scope.
Score it as you score any claim: re-run, don't relay. A worked pass:

- **AC-001, the worker wrote `Pass` and cited `npm test -- auth.spec.ts`.** Re-run that command
  yourself in the worktree. Passes → the row is **Pass**, and *your* pasted output fills the
  Evidence cell. Fails or errors → **Fail** (or **Unverified** if you cannot run it). The worker's
  paste proved the command ran at some past moment, not that it passes now.
- **AC-002, the worker wrote `Pass` with an empty Evidence cell.** Reads **Unverified**: a Pass
  needs evidence, and an empty cell is the absence of it (the gate blocks this: core check
  **C016**). Re-run to settle it; do not inherit the green.
- **The diff shape vs the claimed scope.** The Run summary names `src/auth/refresh.ts`. The diff
  also touched `src/billing/invoice.ts`, which the summary never mentions and the task's Affected
  areas do not cover. That mismatch is an exception trigger (a changed-not-claimed / out-of-scope
  fact) routed to Human attention. Surface it even if every requirement row is green.
- **Provenance is evidence, not a pass.** If the run records *how* it was isolated (its own
  worktree vs a shared checkout) and what it loaded, read it to judge attribution. A shared
  worktree where edits were not isolated to one branch means treat scope and provenance as
  unverified until shown otherwise. A worker's "I followed the discipline" is a claim like any
  other; the diff and your re-run are the evidence.

The rule underneath: a delegated run gives you a richer *claim* to check, never a result you can
copy. You produce the verdict from your own re-run and your read of the diff. The worker's summary
points your attention; it does not score the work.

## Results and packet status

Each coverage row carries one result:

| Result         | Meaning                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pass**       | Verified — pasted output, a CI link, or a named human's recorded observation (manual method) |
| **Fail**       | Verified and the requirement is not met                        |
| **Unverified** | No evidence — including every empty Evidence cell              |
| **Blocked**    | Cannot be verified until something else is resolved            |

The packet itself carries a status in its frontmatter: `draft` (being filled) · `pass`
(every row Pass, decision is merge) · `waived` (merged with a recorded waiver) · `blocked`
(an open critical item holds the merge) ·
`needs-human` (exceptions routed, awaiting a human call). A richer result vocabulary exists
for advanced workflows — see [`reference/advanced-lifecycle.md`](reference/advanced-lifecycle.md).

These five are the whole set; don't invent new ones. "Implemented and committed, but human or
runtime validation is still pending" is **not** a new status. It is this packet `needs-human` with
the task at `review-ready` on the board. At closeout, confirm the board row **and** the task
packet's own `status:` move together (a worker that boots from a stale packet inherits stale state).

## When review sends work back

A `Fail`, an unresolved `Blocked`, or a `needs-human` call does not reopen the spec or grow the
current packet. It starts another turn of the loop. Cut a **bounded follow-up task** scoped to
exactly the rows that didn't pass (plus any out-of-scope edits to revert), point it at the same
spec, run it like any other. The requirement IDs are stable, so the next review packet
reconciles against the same IDs: you see at a glance which previously-failing rows now pass. The
board row moves back to `ready` (or stays `blocked` while a human question is open) and forward
again through `running` → `review-ready`. The spec stays the fixed contract the whole way.

Keep rework as bounded as the first attempt. A follow-up that keeps growing signals an
underspecified spec. Amend the spec; don't let the task sprawl to cover what the contract should
have said.

## What a review is not

- **Not a PR replacement.** The packet links the PR; the PR (and your CI) remains the merge
  mechanism. The packet is the record of _what was verified against the spec_ — something a
  diff view never shows.
- **Not an AI bug-hunter.** Code-review bots flag defects in the diff; the packet routes human
  attention by requirement coverage. Use both — they don't compete.
- **Not a guarantee.** A packet full of Pass rows with real evidence is strong signal, not proof
  of correctness. That's why the spot-check rule and the exception triggers exist.

Once the decision is made, one step remains: [close the task and save what you
learned](09-saving-findings.md).
