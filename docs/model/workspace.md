# Workspace Model

> Swarm's reference for the workspace model: the adopted-project directory shape — the eight `.swarm/` directory contracts, the `.agents/` compatibility model, the one governing placement rule, the five source-code surface policies, and the commit policy.

This page fixes the **adopted-project workspace** — the directory shape that appears inside a *consuming* project after it adopts Swarm. It is distinct from the framework-dev repository layout (the `docs/`, `examples/`, `evals/`, and `kernel/` siblings that explain, demonstrate, self-test, and package the kernel, §20.0). The framework repo is the **producer**; an adopted project is the **product**. The two MUST NOT be conflated.

As with everything in the kernel this is **NO RUNTIME** (Invariant 1, §2.1.1): the kernel is inert reference data and copyable templates, and every workspace path below is a directory a human or an agent populates — or that a future Swarm toolchain would populate **as a contract it builds against**, never a runtime Swarm ships. Every "runs" / "populates automatically" verb on this page resolves to that future-launcher contract.

## The one rule

The placement of every adopted-project artifact is decided by a single rule (§20.5.4):

```text
If it defines, tracks, or reconciles project intent   → .swarm/
If it exists only so an agent CLI can load instructions → .agents/
If it starts an agent correctly                        → AGENTS.md
```

This is **design rationale** — a layout and naming decision, not an empirical claim. The only grounded constraint in the workspace model is the NO-RUNTIME framing above (Invariant 1).

## `.swarm/` is the canonical workspace

`.swarm/` is **the** canonical Swarm workspace: everything that defines, tracks, or reconciles intent lives under it. It partitions into eight top-level categories — `sources/ status/ generated/ memory/ ledger/ archive/ kernel/ tmp/` — each a distinct contract:

| Directory | Holds | Category | Committed? | Populated by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kernel/` | The installed framework payload — `language/ templates/ passes/ skills/ profiles/ overlays/`. Framework-owned; project edits belong in `overlays/`. | payload | Yes | Installation from the framework repo's `kernel/`; kernel migrations |
| `sources/` | **Desired truth** + durable source artifacts: specs (`*.swarm.md`), PRDs, RFCs, research, audits, bugs, findings, ADRs, interfaces, NFRs (§20.3.4). | desired | Yes | Humans + the `author`/`improve` passes |
| `status/` | **Observed** satisfaction + drift: per-spec satisfaction reports, task/worktree state, drift reports. Records whether code satisfies the spec; never redefines intent. | observed | Yes | The `verify`/`review` passes; drift detection (future toolchain) |
| `generated/` | **Generated** execution packets: task frames, traces, reviews, generated tests/docs. Recreatable from `sources/`; compacted into `ledger/` on completion. | generated | Mostly gitignored (see commit policy) | The `lower`/`decompose`/`implement`/`verify`/`review` passes |
| `memory/` | **Durable recall** (§23): `INDEX.md` (the load-*when* map, never a dump), `glossary.md`, `patterns/`, `stale/`. | durable | Yes | The `promote` pass |
| `ledger/` | **Compact reconciled history** (§23): `changes/ merges/ promotions/`. | durable | Yes | Reconciliation after merge/abandonment (future toolchain) |
| `archive/` | Retired durable source artifacts, each linked to a replacement or closure summary — not silently deleted. | durable | Yes | The `promote` pass / manual retirement |
| `tmp/` | Scratch only. No durable knowledge. | scratch | No | Ad-hoc agent/human scratch |

The canonical tree (path *shape* is normative, §20.5.1):

    archive/                # retired source artifacts (linked to replacements)
    tmp/                    # scratch (gitignored)

  .agents/                  # COMPATIBILITY MIRROR ONLY (not canonical)
    skills/                 # mirrored/pointer → .swarm/kernel/skills/
    profiles/               # mirrored/pointer → .swarm/kernel/profiles/
```

## The source / status / generated split

The three execution-time categories are kept deliberately separate, because they answer three different questions and one must never silently overwrite another:

- **`sources/` — desired truth.** What the project *intends*: the obligation source. A spec here is primary for **intent**.
- **`status/` — observed satisfaction + drift.** Whether the code actually satisfies that intent, and where it has drifted. It **records** reality against intent; it **never redefines** intent.
- **`generated/` — execution packets.** The task frames, traces, and reviews produced while turning a source into verified change. Recreatable from `sources/`, and compacted into `ledger/` on completion so the workspace does not accumulate a permanent scratchpad.

This split is the workspace-wide form of the per-path surface policy below: each names which side of the intent-versus-reality reconciliation an artifact (or a code region) sits on.

## The ledger

`.swarm/ledger/` is the **compact reconciled history**: a durable, low-volume summary that survives after `generated/` execution packets are compacted away. Each ledger entry preserves what a future audit needs — **obligation coverage, changed surfaces, the proof run, the verdicts, and the promotion results** — so a completed unit of work leaves a permanent reconciled record rather than an ever-growing pile of task scratchpads. It is committed (`changes/ merges/ promotions/`); `generated/tasks/` and `tmp/` are not. The ledger is what lets `generated/` be safely gitignored: the durable facts have already been lifted out of it.

## The resumption record

Because every durable artifact lives in `.swarm/` rather than in a model's context window, a task that spans more than one session does not have to be re-derived when a fresh session picks it up. The workspace *is* the resumption record. A new session reconstructs where the work stands by reading the same three durable surfaces that govern the work in the first place: the `sources/` artifact that fixes desired truth, the `status/` entry that records observed satisfaction and the task's current state, and — once a unit completes — the `ledger/` entry that compacts what the reconciliation produced. Decisions, findings, and the next concrete starting points are written into that durable state as the work proceeds, so the file content is full even when the context window is empty.

This is the same file-state-externalization discipline as the rest of the workspace, applied to continuity in time: the kernel deliberately does not try to solve long-context coherence at the model layer. Sessions time out and workers swap mid-task; the response is to externalize state so the next session lands in the same epistemic position the last one left, loading what the task names rather than re-investigating it. For how a task's own file carries this resumption state across sessions, see [the evidence](../research/task-files.md).

## Source-code surface policies

The workspace separation has a per-path projection over the codebase itself. A code region declares **exactly one** policy from a closed set of five (§16.6.2). This follows from **Invariant 4 — code is reality**: specs are primary for intent, code is primary for implementation reality, and the trace/review/status layer reconciles the two. A surface policy records which side of that reconciliation a region sits on.

| Policy | Meaning | Manual edits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generated` | Regenerated from a **named source artifact** (an OpenAPI doc, a schema, an interface spec) — the artifact is the truth, the file is its emission. | **Forbidden** — edit the source and regenerate; a hand-edit is overwritten and is a finding. |
| `governed` | Reconciled implementation reality under an obligation: a spec owns intent, the code owns realization, trace/review reconcile them. | **Allowed only with an obligation trace** (`allowed_with_trace`) — every change carries an obligation id and emits a trace. |
| `observed` | Existing code not yet governed — pre-existing reality with no obligation behind it. | Allowed, but the surface needs an audit + a spec before it can become `governed`. |
| `external` | Vendor / third-party code (dependencies, generated SDKs you do not own, copied upstream). | **Do not modify** — changes belong upstream or in an owned wrapper. |
| `deprecated` | Scheduled for removal or migration; retained until cutover. | Discouraged; permitted edits SHOULD be migration/removal steps, not new behavior. |

`observed` is the **honest default** for brownfield adoption: real code that no obligation yet claims. It is the on-ramp — an audit (`.swarm/sources/audits/`) plus a spec promote `observed` → `governed`; it is never silently treated as if a spec already governed it.

The doctrine this set **rejects** is equally important (§16.6.1): code is *not* disposable, source is *not* "regenerated from specs," manual edits are *not* forbidden, and the model MAY *not* rewrite the codebase from prose intent. Code is reconciled implementation reality, not a minified build product of the spec. Only a surface explicitly marked `generated` is regenerated, and even then only from a named source artifact.

Surfaces are declared as a `surfaces:` map in `.swarm/config.yaml`, each path → `{policy, source, manual_edits}` (plus policy-specific fields such as `requires_audit`). Computing and enforcing the map is a future-tool concern; the **map shape is the kernel contract today**.

## `.agents/` is a compatibility surface, not the source of truth

`.agents/` exists **only** so a third-party agent CLI that looks for `.agents/skills/` or `.agents/profiles/` can find loadable instructions. It is never the canonical home of project intent. Every file in `.agents/` MUST either point back to its canonical `.swarm/kernel/` (or `.swarm/generated/`) original, or be a verbatim compatibility copy of kernel material. The mirror is **one-directional** — `.agents/` derives from `.swarm/`, never the reverse — so there is exactly one source of truth and the compatibility surface can be regenerated or deleted without losing intent.

A canonical artifact that exists *only* under `.agents/` is a layout defect, not a valid adoption. In particular, the following are canonical in `.swarm/` and MUST NOT live in `.agents/` as their primary home: primary specs (`.swarm/sources/specs/`), source-authority docs (PRDs, RFCs, research, ADRs, audits, findings, NFRs, interfaces), durable memory, the ledger, and status reports. (A spec root, a task root, or a memory root living *canonically* under `.agents/` is exactly the anti-pattern this rule forbids; any such path is permissible only as an explicitly-marked compatibility pointer or migration step.)

## The CLI / agent boundary

Swarm coordinates agent-CLI workers and **prepares and validates** work; it does **not** own the model loop, the file-editing mechanics, or the provider/MCP runtime, and it MUST NOT replace an agent CLI. The future launcher is a contract a toolchain builds against — it would scaffold task frames, bind `VERIFY BY` adapters through `AGENTS.md > Commands`, serialize write surfaces, and reconcile the ledger — all consistent with the orchestrator-worker, single-threaded-writes boundary. No canonical page implies Swarm is an agent runtime: there is no "Swarm is an agent CLI" and no "agent runtime" here. Every "runs" verb resolves to that future-launcher contract (Invariant 1).

## Commit policy (informative)

An adopted project SHOULD gitignore execution-local and scratch state while committing everything that defines, tracks, or reconciles intent:

```gitignore
# Swarm execution-local + scratch state (recreatable from sources)
.swarm/generated/tasks/
.swarm/tmp/
# Optional: active traces/reviews are compacted into .swarm/ledger/ on completion.
.swarm/generated/traces/
.swarm/generated/reviews/
```

A project MUST NOT gitignore `.swarm/sources/`, `.swarm/status/`, `.swarm/memory/`, `.swarm/ledger/`, `.swarm/kernel/`, or `.swarm/archive/` unless it intentionally splits durable knowledge into a separate repository. `generated/` and `tmp/` are reconstructible from `sources/`; the rest are the durable record the reconciliation model depends on.
