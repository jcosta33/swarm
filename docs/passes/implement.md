# The `implement` pass

> Swarm's reference for the `implement` pass: the pass that produces the change for assigned obligations, records TRACE claims, and gathers proof evidence — its pass frame (`task.md`), its claim output (`trace.md`), the COVERAGE gate that guards its entry, and the owned-path containment rule.

`implement` is the sixth of the **nine passes** of the Swarm compiler pipeline (`author -> lint -> improve -> lower -> decompose -> implement -> verify -> review -> promote`). This page is the reference for that single pass.

Like every Swarm pass, `implement` has **no runtime**: it is a contract a human, an agent following a pass guide, or a future tool performs. Nothing here is shipped code (Invariant 1).

## What the pass does

The `implement` pass **produces the change for the assigned obligations only, records TRACE claims, and runs bound proofs to gather evidence**. It consumes one `task.md` work packet and emits code/docs/tests changes plus a `trace.md`.

| Aspect | Value (from §9.3) |
|---|---|
| Phase | **`EXECUTE`** — "Code, docs, and tests are produced against the lowered work packets" |
| Input artifact | `task.md` (the lowered work packet for one pass) |
| Output artifacts | code/docs/tests changes + `trace.md` (`*.swarm.trace.md` when emitted) |
| Nature of the phase | **Heuristic** (per the §9.1 phase table; the deterministic re-check is `verify`) |
| Typical carrier profile (§27) | **by task kind** (§28): Janitor, Migrator, Performance-Surgeon, Builder, Test-Author, Documentarian |
| Lint layer (§8) | — (`implement` emits no lint codes; its TRACE claims feed `verify`/`review`) |

`implement` is the only pass whose carrier profile is selected **by task kind** rather than fixed — the `task_kind` frontmatter enum on the incoming `task.md` parameterizes which profile and procedure run (§9.3, §28).

## Where it sits in the pipeline

The seven **phases** are `PARSE -> NORMALIZE -> LOWER -> EXECUTE -> VERIFY -> REVIEW -> PROMOTE`. `implement` is the single pass mapped to the **`EXECUTE`** phase. It runs after `decompose` (which partitions the IR into write-disjoint `task.md` packets) and before `verify` (which re-runs every bound proof deterministically).

The partial order is mandatory: for a single obligation the pass order MUST be respected — an obligation cannot be `verify`-ed before it is `implement`-ed, nor `implement`-ed before it is `lower`-ed (§9.2). A launcher MAY interleave passes across multiple specs and MAY run write-disjoint `implement` packets in parallel, but it MUST NOT reorder this partial order for one obligation.

Two contract notes bear on `implement`'s position (§9.3.1):

- **`implement` consumes a `task.md`, not the surface spec or the IR.** `decompose` already computed the work-packet boundaries from the typed IR graph; `implement` works against the packet it was handed.
- **`verify` is the only profile-independent pass.** Whatever heuristic profile `implement` runs under (selected by task kind), it does **not** decide whether an obligation passes. `implement` *gathers* evidence (the `PROOF` lines in its TRACE claims); the deterministic `verify` pass turns evidence into a core verdict. A profile may influence which proofs are *demanded*, never whether a run `PASS`-es.

## The COVERAGE gate guards entry into `implement` (§11.6.2)

`implement` is gated. The `LOWER -> EXECUTE` boundary (after `decompose`, before any `implement` pass runs) carries the **COVERAGE gate** — a precondition predicate over the lowered IR and the plan, not a transformation. The pipeline MUST NOT advance an obligation into `implement` while the predicate is unsatisfied. Two conditions MUST hold (**R-COVERAGE-GATE**):

1. **Total coverage.** Every lowered obligation node (every `REQ` / `CONSTRAINT` / `INVARIANT` / `INTERFACE`, including each `AND THE`-split sub-obligation) is assigned to **exactly one `implement` packet** — none unassigned (uncovered), none double-owned. (The same obligation legitimately recurs in its `implement`, `verify`, and `review` packets across passes; the coverage count is per `implement` packet.)
2. **No orphan targets.** Every `verified_by` edge and every TRACE `implements`/`preserves` edge resolves to a real obligation node id in `nodes[]`. A TRACE or VERDICT whose target id does not resolve is an orphan and MUST NOT be admitted.

The diagnostics this gate aggregates:

| Condition | Code | Layer | Status | Resolves by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Obligation covered by no packet | `SOL-O007` (uncovered obligation) | O (orchestration) | **BLOCKING** | `SCOPE` — assign it to a packet, or record it as an explicit non-goal |
| Obligation assigned to two `implement` packets | `SOL-O008` (double-owned obligation) | O (orchestration) | **BLOCKING** | re-partition so exactly one packet owns it |
| TRACE/VERDICT target id not in `nodes[]` | `SOL-M003` (unbound cross-reference) | M (semantic) | surfaced at `review` | bind the reference to a real node, or drop the claim |

The gate is the **structural complement of the distillation-loss rule** (§11.4, §24): distillation-loss forbids *dropping* an obligation during lowering; the COVERAGE gate forbids *stranding* one afterward. Together they make the lowered work a bijection over obligations — nothing lost in lowering, nothing left uncovered or pointed at a phantom. Like every Swarm gate it is a contract **checkable today by review and enforced by a future tool**: today the `decompose` carrier (Lead Engineer) verifies it by hand against the IR; a future compiler computes it mechanically from `nodes[]`, `edges[]`, and `plan.packets[]`. A conformant repository MUST NOT claim it is enforced by shipped tooling.

## The owned-path containment rule (G7, §11.3)

The `task.md` an `implement` run owns declares **owned paths** (its `write_surfaces`). These MUST be derived from, and bounded by, the assigned obligations' declared write surfaces:

> **R-OWNED-SUBSET.** An execution-tier owned path MUST be a subset of the union of its assigned obligations' `WRITES` surfaces.

An owned path that touches a file outside any assigned obligation's declared write surface is lint code **`SOL-O005`** ("owned path outside declared write surface"). This is what keeps parallel `implement` packets write-disjoint — the property `decompose` proved using the write-surface conflict graph (§18).

## `implement` IS a stdlib pass guide

Of the nine passes, exactly **five** ship with a stdlib pass guide in v0.1: `lint`, `decompose`, `implement`, `review[profile: skeptic]`, and `promote` (§9.4). `implement` is one of them. Rationale (§9.4): it is **the most-run pass**, and so benefits most from a written procedure; its carrier profile is selected **by task kind** (§28), not fixed. A pass guide is SOFT control (Invariant 2): it MUST NOT define SOL/APS semantics, modality, authority order, or verification meaning — those live only in SOL and the IR.

## The input: the `task.md` pass frame (§21.3)

A `task.md` is a *pass frame and execution companion*: the lowered work packet for one pass over assigned source. Its frontmatter carries the full field set the lowering pass needs to prove disjointness, and its body sections bound the work.

**Frontmatter** (MUST carry the full set): `type: task`, `id`, `status` (`active | blocked | done | abandoned`; `done` is terminal), `task_kind` (enum), `source`, `assigned_obligations`, `constraints`, `invariants`, `interfaces`, `write_surfaces`, `verification_bindings`, the coordination fields `parallel_group` and `blocked_by`, `produces` (the artifact paths this pass emits under `generated/` — e.g. the `trace.md` it writes; `[]` when the pass emits no durable artifact), plus the optional `pass`, `pass_guides`, and `profile` the task activates (§26.4).

> **`write_surfaces` MUST be a subset of the assigned obligations' `WRITES` surfaces** — an owned path outside a declared write surface is the `SOL-O005` defect above (G7).

The `task_kind` enum is the parameter that selects which pass and profile run (§28):
`feature | fix | refactor | rewrite | migration | upgrade | performance | testing | documentation | spec-writing | research-writing | audit-writing | bug-report-writing | review | orchestration | integration | deepen-audit`.

**Body sections** a conformant `task.md` MUST contain:

| Section | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `## Parent contract` | The inherited hand-off: objective + deliverable + acceptance bar + boundaries (owned vs forbidden paths). |
| `## Scope` | An explicit **In / Out** list bounding the pass. |
| `## Assigned obligations` | The exact assigned SOL blocks, pasted verbatim. |
| `## Constraints and invariants` | The SOL blocks this task MUST preserve. |
| `## Implementation or pass trace` | What changed, per obligation. |
| `## Verification matrix` | Required proof → actual proof → 7-value status, per obligation. |
| `## Promotion queue` | Discoveries with target + promotion status (§23); all MUST be resolved before task close. |
| `## Self-review` | The structured self-review block (did I do only this pass; preserve semantics; map every claim to evidence). |

The default `## Scope > Out` list is itself a boundary statement of the pass: *do not implement unassigned obligations; do not change behavior outside the assigned write surfaces; do not weaken constraints, invariants, or non-goals.*

## The output: the `trace.md` claim contract (§21.4)

`implement` emits a `trace.md` that records implementation *claims* against obligations and binds them to *evidence*. Its core payload is one or more `TRACE` blocks (`IMPLEMENTS` / `PRESERVES` / `CHANGED` / `PROOF`, §6) plus the drift-provenance fields (§16) the staleness join depends on. A conformant `trace.md` MUST contain:

| Section | Meaning |
|---|---|
| frontmatter | `type: trace`, `id`, `source_task`, `source_spec`, `created`. |
| `## Claimed implementation` | The `TRACE` blocks. |
| `## Provenance` | The seven §16.1 / G11 fields **per binding**: `source_hash`, `per_surface_hash[]` (one `{surface, hash, exercised}` per declared `WRITES` and proof-exercised `READS` surface), `adapter`, `verdict`, `tier`, `origin_obligations[]`, `origin_traces[]`. These flip a PASS to `STALE` when source or surface drifts (§16). |
| `## Verification matrix` | ID → required proof → actual proof → 7-value status. |
| `## Unassigned changes` | Any change outside assigned obligations, with reason + authorizing ID or `none`. |
| `## Promotion items` | Discoveries to promote, with target + status. |

How a TRACE block records the claim (§6, §12.5):

- `IMPLEMENTS` lists the `REQ` ids the change satisfies; `PRESERVES` lists the `CONSTRAINT`/`INVARIANT` ids it must not violate; `CHANGED` names the modified surfaces (the basis for staleness detection); each `PROOF` line names a verification reference plus its observed `proof_result` — `passed | failed | blocked | unverified`.
- The lowercase `proof_result` is the *observed run outcome*; it maps **1:1** to the uppercase VERDICT core value at the `verify`/`review` step: `passed -> PASS`, `failed -> FAIL`, `blocked -> BLOCKED`, `unverified -> UNVERIFIED`. The verdict has **7 values total — 4 core** (`PASS`/`FAIL`/`BLOCKED`/`UNVERIFIED`) **+ 3 lifecycle** (`WAIVED`/`STALE`/`CONTRADICTED`, §14) — but `implement` only ever produces the core observation; the lifecycle decorators are applied later at `review`.
- A TRACE that claims `IMPLEMENTS` **MUST carry at least one `PROOF` line** — the grammar makes `PROOF` mandatory in a trace body, so a no-`PROOF` trace is a structural parse error (`SOL-S014`), not a missing-evidence lint. A `PROOF` line MUST reference real output: an unqualified "tests passed" is not admissible (§15, §17).
- A TRACE whose `IMPLEMENTS`/`PRESERVES` names an unknown obligation is `SOL-M003` (unbound cross-reference) — the same orphan-target condition the COVERAGE gate guards against.

In the IR, these claims become `implements` and `preserves` edges in the single relationship store `edges[]` (§12.5) — the input the downstream `verify` and `review` passes join against the obligation graph.

## What `implement` MUST NOT do

The pass frame and the trace contract together fence the change:

- **Only the assigned obligations.** `implement` produces the change for *the assigned obligations only* (§9.3). Any change that is not traceable to an assigned obligation is an `## Unassigned changes` row in the trace (with reason + authorizing ID or `none`), to be judged at `review`.
- **Only within the declared write surfaces.** Owned paths MUST stay a subset of the assigned `WRITES` surfaces (G7 / `SOL-O005`).
- **No weakening of intent.** Constraints, invariants, and non-goals are preserved, not relaxed — changing obligation intent is an amendment decision (§10 R-IMPROVE), never an `implement` action.
- **No fabricated evidence.** A `PROOF` line references real verification output; schema-valid shape is not a proof (§15).

## Task-kind contracts

`implement` is the one pass whose carrier profile is selected **by task kind** (§28), and that choice is not cosmetic: each `task_kind` carries a distinct *discipline* — a specific failure mode the pass is built to prevent and a specific shape of evidence it must gather. The defaults below are design rationale, not gates; load what the task names, and where the work in front of you diverges from the shape, record the divergence in the task frame and pick the discipline whose description matches. The proof side of every one of these lives at the deterministic [`verify` pass](verify.md) — these contracts say *what evidence to gather*; `verify` says *whether it counts*.

| `task_kind` | The discipline | The oracle it demands |
|---|---|---|
| `refactor` | **Behaviour-preservation.** The change restructures internals; it MUST NOT alter any observable behaviour. The whole risk is a behaviour delta smuggled in under the "purely internal" label — if behaviour moves, it is a `rewrite` or a `migration`, relabel it. | An equivalence (characterization) check that would *fail if behaviour changed* — property-based, differential, or golden-output. A green suite is necessary but not sufficient; it only covers what was already tested, so where no stronger check exists the trace records *why* the existing suite is a sufficient oracle for this change. |
| `rewrite` | **Two-surface verification.** A rewrite *deliberately* changes some behaviour, so unintended changes hide where intentional ones are permitted. Two surfaces must both be proven: the **delta** (the behaviour that was meant to change) and the **preserved surface** (everything else). | The delta is proven against its acceptance checks (each changed behaviour bound to a `test`/`command`/`manual` proof); the non-delta is proven by the same equivalence check `refactor` demands. The delta proves the intended change was built; preservation proves nothing else moved. |
| `migration` | **Wave-planning.** The implementation moves from API A to API B while the surface stays put; the failure modes are the permanent half-migration and the phantom completion (old-API callsites surviving in dynamic dispatch, registries, generated code, reflection). Plan the waves up front; migrate each file deliberately, never with a bulk codemod that silently breaks the one unusual callsite. | A callsite inventory taken up front, per-wave verification (validate + test green at every wave, never accumulating drift to the end), and a `git grep` of the old API driven to zero across the *whole* codebase — plus an explicit audit beyond grep for the references a text search cannot reach. Every shim carries a verifiable removable-when criterion. |
| `performance` | **Measure-first.** Optimisation of a *measured* bottleneck under a *stated* numeric target — never opportunistic tinkering, never a faster wrong answer. The discipline is numbers over vibes and correctness over speed. | A baseline measured *before* touching code, then a target measured under the **same protocol** — identical warmup, sample count, aggregate, hardware, environment — or the comparison is meaningless. Every change is benchmarked individually and the full suite runs after each, because a speedup that broke correctness is still a defect. |
| `flaky-test` | **Reproduce-the-flake-first.** Non-deterministic failure is almost always a *real* signal about timing, ordering, shared state, or environmental coupling. The single most tempting non-fix — re-run until green, then ship the bug — is exactly what the discipline forbids; masking the flake (sleeps, widened assertions, quarantine-as-resolution) suppresses the signal instead of removing the cause. | Reproduce the flake *before* claiming to understand it (loop the test until it fires), root-cause it in production code or test setup rather than the assertion, then prove the fix by loop-running and pasting the pass/fail summary — every run passes, or it is not fixed. The kernel's [`fix-flaky-test` pass guide](../library/pass-guides.md) carries this as a narrow `implement` guide. |
