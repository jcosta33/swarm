# `rfc.md` — technical proposal

An RFC is a source document that records **one technical proposal** put forward for a decision — the problem it solves, the advocated approach, the alternatives weighed, and the exact decision being requested — so that *why this approach and not the alternatives* outlives the change that prompted it. It is a recognized **parent of a spec**: it advocates a mechanism, it commits nothing and carries no obligations of its own, and once its requested decision is made it promotes into an `adr.md` (the immutable decision) and/or a `spec.swarm.md` (the behavioral contract) through the author pass, with its proposal stance preserved across that promotion.

## Purpose & epistemic stance

An RFC asserts a **proposal**: it advocates a single technical approach in enough detail to be evaluated, and records the comparison that justifies preferring it — but it decides nothing. Its knowledge is *pre-decision*. That boundary is load-bearing.

- An `rfc.md` **MUST NOT** author `REQ`, `CONSTRAINT`, `INVARIANT`, or `INTERFACE` obligation blocks. Those blocks come into existence only when the RFC promotes — to an accepted `adr.md`, an approved `spec.swarm.md`, or both — via the author pass. Embedding them in the RFC would let a *proposal* be read as an already-approved contract and silently bypass the authoring step where a proposal acquires obligation force, and the decision step where it acquires commitment. This is the same prohibition that keeps a PRD's goals from being read as `REQ` blocks, an audit from prescribing a fix, and a bug-report from naming an implementation.
- It **commits to none of its alternatives** until the requested decision is made. An RFC advocates one approach but is, until accepted, a record of an open choice. Its `## Migration plan` describes steps and ordering from the present state to the proposed state — it is **never** a set of authored `TRACE` blocks; tracing is what happens after a spec exists, not within a proposal.
- Its `## Alternatives` section is **mandatory and "none considered" is a defect**, because an RFC's durable value is precisely the comparison it records: the reason a future reader can trust the chosen approach is that the rejected ones are written down beside it.
- It is **non-authoritative until accepted-and-authored**. An RFC does not govern the codebase the way a spec or an ADR does. It is the upstream proposal that an author pass reads and turns into obligations (and that a decision turns into an ADR); once promoted, the RFC remains the durable record of the proposal those obligations and that decision serve.

The reason a proposal is captured as its own artifact rather than written straight into a spec or an ADR is provenance: requirements practice distinguishes proposal from intent, evidence, decision, observation, defect, and discovery, and Swarm normalizes all of them into one obligation-bearing spec (and, for the decision itself, an ADR) rather than pretending every approach begins as either settled intent or a finished decision. The RFC is the **proposal** parent in that model — the recognized place where an approach lives while it is still being argued.

## Filename & placement

The RFC obeys the `.swarm.` infix partition that separates compiler-visible files from working artifacts.

- An `rfc.md` is a **working artifact**: its filename **MUST NOT** contain the `.swarm.` infix, and it uses a plain `.md` extension. It is structured Markdown governed by this artifact contract, not by the SOL grammar, and it is never parsed or emitted by a compiler.
- The one human-authored compiler-visible spec is `*.swarm.md`; emitted artifacts take a `*.swarm.*` name (e.g. `*.swarm.ir.json`, `*.swarm.trace.md`). An RFC is neither — it is a hand-authored source that *feeds* a spec and/or an ADR, so it stays plain `.md`.

In an adopted project's `.swarm/` workspace, an RFC is a durable source artifact and lives under `sources/`:

```
.swarm/sources/rfcs/<slug>.md
```

It sits beside the other parents of a spec — `sources/specs/` (the `*.swarm.md` it can promote into), `sources/prds/`, `sources/research/`, `sources/audits/`, `sources/bugs/`, `sources/findings/`, and `sources/adrs/` (the decision it can promote into). RFCs are **never** placed under `generated/` (that directory holds derived execution packets — task frames, traces, reviews — recreatable from sources) and **never** under `memory/` (durable recall; the index, glossary, patterns, and stale records). An RFC is a proposed-design source, so `sources/` is its only home.

## Required sections / fields, in order

A conformant `rfc.md` carries the YAML frontmatter contract followed by six sections, in this order. The `## Alternatives` section is mandatory and **MUST NOT** record "none considered" — an absent comparison is a defect, not an omission.

### Frontmatter contract

```yaml
type: rfc            # fixed; identifies the artifact class
id: <slug>           # stable identifier; the citable name for this proposal
status: proposed     # one of: proposed | accepted | rejected | superseded
created: <date>      # authoring date
updated: <date>      # last-revision date
```

### Sections

| # | Section | What it asserts | Stance rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `## Problem` | The technical problem that forces a proposal. | Cite the originating `prd.md`, `finding.md`, or `audit.md` where one exists. States the problem, never the obligation. |
| 2 | `## Proposal` | The advocated approach, in enough detail to evaluate. | Describes a mechanism; authors **no** obligation blocks. |
| 3 | `## Alternatives` | Other approaches and why each is weaker than the proposal. | **Mandatory; "none considered" is a defect.** An RFC's value is the comparison it records. |
| 4 | `## Migration plan` | How adoption proceeds from the present state to the proposed state. | Steps and ordering only; **never** authored `TRACE` blocks. |
| 5 | `## Open questions` | Unresolved points that gate the decision. | Each is a `QUESTION` (`Q-NNN`) candidate until resolved; an RFC with a blocking open question **MUST NOT** be promoted. |
| 6 | `## Decision requested` | The exact decision being asked for. | Names the promotion target — an accepted `adr.md` and/or an approved `spec.swarm.md`. |

The `## Alternatives` section is a table — `Alternative | Why weaker than the proposal` — because each row is a recorded judgment that a future reader (or a superseding RFC) can reopen: the comparison is the artifact's point, so an RFC that records no alternative has discarded the one thing it exists to preserve. The `## Open questions` section is a **promotion gate**: every unresolved item is a `QUESTION` (`Q-NNN`) candidate, and while any question that blocks the proposal stays open the RFC **MUST NOT** promote — a proposal cannot become an obligation or a decision while the thing that gates it is still undecided.

## Copyable template

The copyable skeleton ships in the kernel at:

```
kernel/.agents/templates/rfc.md
```

That file is the skeleton you copy to start a new RFC; **this page is its contract**. The template carries the frontmatter, the six section headings in order, and inline guidance that restates the proposal-only, no-obligation stance; this page is the authority on what each section means and what the RFC is forbidden to do. Where you are authoring an RFC by hand, copy the template, fill the six sections, and keep every statement on the proposal side of the line — the moment a sentence reads as an approved behavioral contract it belongs in the `spec.swarm.md` the author pass will produce, and the moment it reads as a settled choice it belongs in the `adr.md`, not here.

- **`docs/artifacts/prd.md`** — the **intent** parent (`prd.md`): where an RFC proposes *how* a technical approach delivers an outcome, a PRD states *what outcome* is wanted and why; an RFC's `## Problem` often cites the originating PRD.
- **`docs/artifacts/finding.md`** — the **discovery** parent (`finding.md`): a single durable fact an RFC's `## Problem` may cite as evidence for the proposal it forces.
- **`docs/artifacts/audit.md`** — the **observation** parent (`audit.md`): observed present state and risk an RFC's `## Problem` may cite as the pressure that forces a proposal.
