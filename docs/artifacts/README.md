# Artifacts

This directory is the contract catalogue for every file a Swarm repository may contain: one page per artifact, each fixing that artifact's epistemic stance, required sections, frontmatter, and copyable skeleton. This page is the index — it defines the rules that *apply across* all artifacts (the two-class partition, filenames by class, the recognized parents of a spec, and the conventions every template obeys) and links each per-artifact contract.

Swarm is a spec format plus agents, markdown-only, with no runtime: every "parser/linter/planner/checker" is a CONTRACT a future tool would build against, never shipped code. Nothing here executes: every artifact is inert reference data, a copyable template, or a file a human or agent populates by hand.

## 1. Two classes: specs and working artifacts

Swarm partitions every repository file that participates in the flow into **exactly two classes**:

| Class | How to identify | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Spec** | Frontmatter `type: spec` — the sole source of SOL obligation blocks. | The file is *parsed or emitted*. Its bytes are subject to the SOL surface grammar or to the structured-form / plan JSON schemas. |
| **Working artifact** | Frontmatter `type` is anything else (`task`, `review`, `finding`, `adr`, `audit`, `research`, …) or absent. | A *human / agent working artifact*: structured Markdown governed by an artifact contract on these pages, not by the SOL grammar — though it MAY embed SOL blocks (notably `VERDICT` and `TRACE`) as quoted data. |

A conformant Swarm tool MUST use frontmatter `type: spec` as the **sole, sufficient discriminator** for "do I parse this as SOL source": it MUST NOT parse a working artifact as SOL source, and MUST NOT emit a Swarm-generated output to a path whose frontmatter lacks `type: spec`.

There are three filename shapes:

- **`spec.md`** — the source spec. The **only** human-authored spec artifact.
- **`*.<slug>.json` or `*.trace.md`** — *emitted* Swarm-generated artifacts. A future tool writes these; in this version they are reserved contract names with no shipped emitter.
- **Plain `*.md` (e.g. `task.md`, `audit.md`)** — working artifacts and source documents, authored or worked by hand.

## 2. Canonical filenames by class

### 2.1 Spec artifacts

| Filename pattern | Role | Authored by | Schema / grammar | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spec.md` | Source spec — APS prose interleaved with SOL blocks. | Human / authoring agent | SOL surface grammar + APS prose standard | Live; the only hand-written spec file. |
| `*.ir.json` | Emitted structured form (the obligations). | Future tool | structured-form envelope | **Reserved contract name.** Not written by any shipped tool. |
| `*.plan.json` | Emitted plan (structured, schedulable work packets + graphs). | Future planner tool | Plan envelope | **Reserved contract name.** Not written by any shipped tool. |
| `*.trace.md` | Emitted / instantiated trace for a built spec. | Implement / verify step (today: agent by hand) | Trace contract + provenance | Copyable template is `trace.md` (plain); built *instances* MAY take the `*.trace.md` name. |

The two `.json` variants are **documented-as-contract names only**: Swarm pins their shape so a future launcher can build against a stable target, but Swarm ships no parser, emitter, planner, or checker. A repository MUST NOT claim that any `*.ir.json` or `*.plan.json` is *produced* by a Swarm tool; it MAY hold hand-written examples in the conformance corpus.

### 2.2 Working artifacts (plain `.md`)

| Filename | Role | Class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task.md` | Structured work packet / step frame for one step. | Core (required) |
| `trace.md` | Implementation / preservation claims + evidence against obligations. | Core (required) |
| `review.md` | The verdict record: per-obligation `VERDICT` blocks + matrix + final verdict. | Core (required) |
| `status.md` | Observed-state read-model: per-obligation latest verdict + drift, for one spec. | Execution (derived) |
| `task-orchestration.md` | Coordination record for one parallel decomposition: owned surfaces, hand-offs, liveness, merge log. | Execution (orchestration) |
| `finding.md` | One durable, provenance-anchored project fact. | Core (required) |
| `adr.md` | An immutable architecture decision record (Nygard form). | Core (required) |
| `memory/INDEX.md` | Compact recall map (links + a "Load when" per entry). | Core (required) |
| `memory/glossary.md` | One-word-one-meaning term store. | Memory model |
| `memory/patterns/*.md` | Recurring multi-finding knowledge. | Memory model |
| `audit.md` | Observation-only source document; promotes to a spec. | Source-doc (conditional) |
| `research.md` | Investigation source document; promotes to a spec. | Source-doc (conditional) |
| `bug-report.md` | Diagnosis-only source document; promotes into a fix *task*. | Source-doc (conditional) |
| `prd.md` | Product-intent source document; promotes to a spec. | Source-doc (conditional) |
| `rfc.md` | Technical-proposal source document; promotes to a spec or an ADR. | Source-doc (conditional) |
| `threat-model.md` | Security-domain threat-observation source document; promotes to a spec. | Source-doc (conditional; outside the counted Tier-3 inventory) |

### 2.3 There is NO `verdict.md` (normative)

A repository MUST NOT contain a standalone `verdict.md`, and no tool MAY emit one. `VERDICT` is a SOL *language block*, not a file; `review.md` is its canonical *container*. *Rationale:* a verdict is the output of the review step, exactly as a SARIF `result` lives inside a `run` and never as a free-standing file. Swarm ships documentation of the `VERDICT` block and the verdict taxonomy as a reference page, not as a copyable artifact template.

## 3. The recognized parents of a spec

A spec is not born only from research. Swarm normalizes the many artefacts of requirements practice into one obligation-bearing `spec.md` rather than pretending every intent begins as research. Each **parent** carries an **epistemic stance** — what kind of knowledge it is allowed to assert — and that stance is preserved when its content is promoted into a spec.

| Source class | Canonical artefact | Epistemic stance | Promotes to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intent | `prd.md` | **intent** — desired product outcomes; non-authoritative until authored | a `spec.md` (via `author`) |
| Evidence | `research.md` | **inquiry** — surveys options and evidence; commits to no decision | a `spec.md` (via `author`); many PRDs / specs / ADRs / findings |
| Proposal | `rfc.md` | **proposal** — proposes a design; commits nothing until accepted | a `spec.md` (via `author`) or an `adr.md` |
| Decision | `adr.md` | **decision** — an immutable architecture decision (Nygard) | governs as highest-authority constraint; feeds specs / tasks |
| Observation | `audit.md` | **observation-only** — describes present state and risk; asserts no new intended behavior | a `spec.md` (via `author`); findings / refactor tasks |
| Defect | `bug-report.md` | **diagnosis-only** — reproduces and root-causes; prescribes no fix | a **fix task** (via `implement`) |
| Discovery | `finding.md` | **evidence** — one durable, evidenced project fact | governs as evidence once accepted; feeds specs / ADRs / memory |
| Scenario | `use-case.md` / examples | **scenario** — illustrates desired behavior by example | `REQ` / `INTERFACE` blocks in a spec (via `author`) |
| Interface | OpenAPI / GraphQL / DB schema | **boundary shape** — declares an interface contract | `INTERFACE` (+ `CONSTRAINT`) blocks in a spec (via `author`) |
| Quality attribute | `nfr.md` / SLOs | **quality attribute** — states non-functional targets | `CONSTRAINT` / `INVARIANT` blocks + verification rows (via `author`) |

Two epistemic-stance invariants follow and are normative:

- An `audit.md` MUST NOT carry `REQ` / `CONSTRAINT` / `INVARIANT` obligation blocks of its own intent — observed risk is promoted *into* a spec, where it acquires obligation force.
- A `bug-report.md` MUST NOT prescribe an implementation — its diagnosis promotes *into* a fix task.

`research.md` holds a special role as Swarm's **detached first-class evidence store**: it is not bound to one downstream artefact — one research artefact MAY feed many PRDs, specs, ADRs, findings, or audits at once — which minimizes copying, preserves provenance, and reduces distillation loss when upstream facts evolve.

Of these parents, five are shipped as **stdlib source-doc templates** — `audit.md`, `research.md`, `bug-report.md`, `prd.md`, and `rfc.md`. They are **conditional**: a repository need not have instantiated any of them to be conformant, but the starter kit MUST ship each template. The remaining parents — `use-case.md` / examples, `nfr.md` / SLOs, and interface sources — are **recognized inputs that normalize INTO a spec** during the `author` step and are not necessarily shipped as separate templates. The starter kit MAY additionally ship a `use-case.md` or `nfr.md` template, but MUST NOT treat any source-doc as required for conformance.

## 4. General template conventions

These conventions are normative and apply to **every** artifact template in the catalogue:

- Every artifact MUST carry YAML frontmatter delimited by `---`, with at minimum a `type` field naming the artifact and an `id`. Per-class fields (e.g. `status`, `created`, `updated`, `source_spec`) are fixed on each artifact's own page.
- Placeholder tokens use `{{..}}`. A shipped, *uninstantiated* template MAY leave `{{..}}` placeholders; a **built** (populated) artifact MUST NOT leave a binding clause as a placeholder — an unfilled `VERIFY BY` placeholder in a built artifact is a `SOL-V001` lint defect.
- Tables are the required carrier for every matrix (verification, obligation-verdict, promotion queue). A row whose status cell is empty in a *built* artifact is treated as `UNVERIFIED`.
- Surface SOL blocks embedded in a working artifact (`TRACE` in `trace.md`, `VERDICT` in `review.md`) are quoted SOL data and MUST obey the SOL block grammar — including the canonical vocabulary: the 7 block types, the 5 modal keywords (`MUST` / `MUST NOT` / `SHOULD` / `SHOULD NOT` / `MAY`), the 7 verdicts (4 core `PASS` / `FAIL` / `BLOCKED` / `UNVERIFIED` + 3 lifecycle `WAIVED` / `STALE` / `CONTRADICTED`), the 9 proof types, and the `VERIFY BY <type>:<adapter>:<artifact>` form.

The copyable skeleton for each artifact lives in the starter kit under `starter-kit/.agents/templates/`. Each per-artifact page below is the **contract** for one of those skeletons: the page defines what the artifact means and what its sections require; the template is the file you copy and fill.

## 5. Filename and placement in an adopted project

Each page restates the class rule for its own artifact: `spec.md` is the one human-authored spec source (identified by `type: spec` frontmatter); a built trace MAY take the emitted `*.trace.md` name; every other working artifact and source document is a plain `.md`.

In an adopted project a **feature is a folder**, and an artifact lives with the thing it serves ([ADR-0052](./adrs/0052-per-feature-spec-folders.md)):

- **Feature-scoped source documents** — the contract `spec.md` and its supporting docs (`audit`, `research`, `bug-report`, `prd`, `rfc`, `threat-model`) live together in `specs/<feature>/`. Co-locating a feature's evidence with its contract keeps the requirement→evidence trail in one place [[SPECKIT]](./research/sources.md#SPECKIT) [[KIRO]](./research/sources.md#KIRO).
- **Project-wide decisions** — ADRs live in `decisions/`, sequentially numbered, one per file [[ADR-CONV]](./research/sources.md#ADR-CONV).
- **Durable recall** — `INDEX.md`, `glossary.md`, `patterns/`, and `stale/` live in `.agents/memory/`; a finding is committed here and indexed by `INDEX.md`.
- **Recreatable execution packets** — task frames (`task.md`), traces (`trace.md`), reviews (`review.md`), generated tests and docs: execution scratch, gitignored or created lazily by a future tool.

Swarm identifies an artifact by its frontmatter `type:`, not its path, so a tool finds it wherever it sits — these homes are the legible default. The copyable templates themselves ship with the installed starter kit, each carrying a "Lives in:" line naming its home.

## 6. The artifact contract pages
