# `finding.md`

A finding is one durable, provenance-anchored project fact discovered during work — the unit of evidence the memory recall map links into so a future task can find what an earlier task learned. This page is the contract that file class must satisfy.

## Purpose and epistemic stance

A finding asserts **evidence**: a single, falsifiable proposition learned while doing real work, anchored to the artifacts that ground it and scoped to the conditions under which it holds. It is durable *discovery*, not *intent* — it records what was found to be true, never what behavior the system is required to have.

That stance fixes a hard boundary on what a finding may contain:

- A finding **MUST NOT** carry its own obligation blocks. It declares no `REQ`, `CONSTRAINT`, `INVARIANT`, or `INTERFACE` of its own force. A finding has no authority to require behavior; if a discovery implies a behavior the system should have, that intent is promoted *into* a spec, where it acquires obligation force, and only there. This mirrors the discipline observation-only artifacts follow — an audit records present-state risk but declares no new intended behavior; a bug-report root-causes a defect but prescribes no fix.
- A finding **MUST** state exactly **one** durable fact. A claim that bundles several propositions cannot be falsified, scoped, or staleness-checked as a unit; split it into one finding per fact.
- A finding **MUST** be falsifiable. Without provenance — the file, command, output, or source that grounds it — a finding is chat, not memory: unindexed, unprovenanced, and unable to be re-verified or retired.
- A finding **MUST** name its scope. If it cannot say *when* the fact applies (`## Applies when`), it **MUST NOT** be promoted. A fact with no scope envelope is dead weight against memory density and cannot be matched to a future task.

Once a finding reaches `accepted`, its **body is immutable**: its status may advance, but the recorded fact and evidence do not silently change. A finding that is later disproved or replaced is retired through status (`stale`/`superseded`) or withdrawn through rollback — never edited in place. This keeps the discovery chain auditable.

Where a finding governs once accepted: it carries weight as durable evidence in the source-authority model, ranking below intent (specs) and decisions (ADRs) — it informs and grounds obligations, it does not outrank them. A promotion that would *weaken* an existing obligation is forbidden at every target, because memory is the floor of the authority model, not a lever over intent.

## Filename and placement

`finding.md` is a **working artifact**, not a compiler-visible source. The discriminator is the `.swarm.` filename infix:

- The single human-authored compiler-visible spec is `*.swarm.md`.
- Emitted, contract-shaped compiler outputs carry the `.swarm.*` infix (for example `*.swarm.ir.json`, `*.swarm.trace.md`).
- Working artifacts — findings, tasks, reviews, ADRs — carry **no** infix and use a plain `.md` extension.

A finding is structured Markdown governed by this contract; it is **not** parsed as SOL source, and it **MUST NOT** be given a per-artifact `.swarm.*` name. A conformant tool treats the missing infix as sufficient proof not to parse the file as a spec.

In an adopted `.swarm/` workspace, a finding is a durable source artifact and lives under `sources/`:

```text
.swarm/
  sources/
    findings/        # finding.md instances live here (durable discovery)
  memory/
    INDEX.md         # Tier-1 recall map: links each promoted finding with a "Load when"
    patterns/        # Tier-2 recurring knowledge that GENERALIZES several findings
```

A finding is **not** generated material: it is desired-truth-adjacent durable knowledge, committed, and never placed in `generated/` (recreatable execution packets) or `tmp/` (scratch). It is the Tier-2 evidence store that the Tier-1 `memory/INDEX.md` map points at; the index links into a finding's body but never duplicates it. A single finding is **never** promoted directly to a `memory/patterns/*.md` pattern — a pattern distills two or more corroborating findings and must cite the findings it generalizes.

## Required sections and fields, in order

### YAML frontmatter

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | always | Literal `finding`. |
| `id` | always | The finding slug (matches the filename / index entry). |
| `status` | always | `candidate \| accepted \| promoted \| rejected \| stale \| superseded`. Advances forward; goes `stale` when `content_hash` no longer matches the cited source, `superseded` when replaced. |
| `created` / `updated` | always | The provenance timestamp (`created` at discovery; `updated` on each status transition). |
| `confidence` | always | `high \| medium \| low`. |
| `origin_obligations` | on promotion | The obligation IDs (`AC-`/`C-`/`I-`/`IF-…`) the fact was discovered against. |
| `origin_traces` | on promotion | The trace entries (`*.swarm.trace.md#<ID>`) that produced the evidence. |
| `pass` + `profile` | on promotion | The pass and heuristic profile under which it was found (for example `review` + `skeptic`). |
| `reviewer_or_tool` | on promotion | The human reviewer or tool/adapter that confirmed it. |
| `content_hash` | on promotion | Hash of the cited source/surfaces at promotion time; this is the input the staleness check compares against. |

The full provenance set is **mandatory on every finding that reaches `accepted` or `promoted`**. A `candidate` finding may be drafted with provenance fields still empty, but it MUST NOT be promoted until they are populated — provenance is what makes the fact falsifiable and staleness-checkable.

### Body sections

| Section | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `# Finding: <title>` | The finding's title. |
| `## Claim` | The one durable fact, stated as a single falsifiable proposition. |
| `## Evidence` | The File / Command / Output / Source references that ground the claim. |
| `## Applies when` | The scope conditions under which the fact holds. **Mandatory** — a finding that cannot name this MUST NOT be promoted. |
| `## Does not apply when` | The conditions under which the fact does **not** hold; the other half of the scope envelope. |
| `## Related obligations` | Obligation IDs the fact bears on, beyond its `origin_obligations[]` provenance. |
| `## Promotion target` | The promotion route: keep-scoped, promote into spec / audit / ADR / memory pattern, or mark stale/superseded. |
| `## Status history` | Append-only status transitions, one line per transition; prior lines are never edited. |

`## Applies when` and `## Does not apply when` mirror the `Load when` trigger the finding's `memory/INDEX.md` entry carries: the scope that decides when a future task should recall the fact.

## Copyable template

The copyable skeleton is `kernel/.agents/templates/finding.md`. That file is the empty starting point an author copies to create a new finding; **this page is its contract** — the meaning of each field, the epistemic boundary, and the placement rules the skeleton is filled in against. In an adopted project the same skeleton is installed at `.swarm/kernel/templates/finding.md`.
