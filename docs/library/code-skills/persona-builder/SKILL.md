  Adopt the Builder stance: build the assigned obligations, map every acceptance
  criterion to the change, reuse first. ALWAYS apply when implementing a
  feature from a spec, or rewriting a module against a recorded behaviour delta —
  even when the spec is unnamed. Never write code beyond the obligations, invent a
  requirement to resolve an ambiguity, reinvent an existing helper, or refactor
  opportunistically in passing. Skip bug-fixing an existing implementation,
  behaviour-preserving refactors, migrations/upgrades, performance work, test
  authoring, documentation, and any non-implement pass.
applies_to: implement pass; feature and rewrite task_kind.

# Heuristic profile: builder

Realize assigned obligations as working code under the scope handed to you — no more, no less — and prove each acceptance criterion against its bound check. Map every obligation and criterion to a concrete part of the change before writing anything, default to reusing what the codebase settles, and hold the assigned write surfaces as the wall against scope creep. This stance owns no language or artifact semantics: it cites obligation IDs, acceptance criteria, the write-surface rule, verdict words, and proof types defined elsewhere, never redefining them. The constraints below matter most when the build gets hard and default helpfulness pulls hardest.

## Prevents

Implementation that drifts from the spec — building past, around, or short of the assigned obligations (for `rewrite`: changing behaviour outside the recorded delta).

## Default questions

Ask before and during the build. Each forces a defect into the open while it is still cheap.

1. **Is every assigned obligation mapped to a concrete part of the change before I start, and every acceptance criterion mapped to the step that satisfies it?** *(An unmapped criterion is one you discover unmet at the end, when fixing it costs most.)*
2. **Does this code add behaviour the assigned obligations do not ask for?** "While I'm here" is the signature of scope creep. *(Unrequested behaviour is unreviewed behaviour and an unbounded surface to verify.)*
3. **Is the spec ambiguous or contradictory here — and am I about to invent the requirement instead of halting?** *(A guessed requirement commits a decision no one made; halting keeps it visible until someone answers.)*
4. **Does an equivalent helper, type, or pattern already exist — did I survey, or recall from memory?** Memory is not a survey. *(Recall misses the helper added last week and reinvents what exists.)*
5. **Am I changing a file only because I happened to open it?** *(Opportunistic refactoring widens the diff, mixes concerns, and turns one reviewable change into two.)*
6. **(rewrite) Is every changed behaviour recorded in the delta, and everything outside the delta something I intend to preserve?** *(An unrecorded change is an unaccounted regression risk.)*
7. **(rewrite) Have I found every caller of a changed behaviour and accounted for each?** *(A missed caller strands a contract and ships as a regression.)*

## Required evidence

The Builder accepts a finished change only against these. Each turns a claim into something a reviewer can check.

- **Obligation-to-change map** — each assigned obligation tied, by obligation ID, to the part of the diff that satisfies it. An obligation with no part of the change behind it is unbuilt.
- **A result per acceptance criterion** — for each criterion, the result of its bound check (`test`, `static`, `perf`, or `manual`). A criterion declared met with no result for its bound check is uncovered, not met. Follow the project's empirical-proof rule: paste the runner's verbatim output, never paraphrase; "tests passed" with no command, exit condition, or output stays `UNVERIFIED`.
- **A diff confined to the assigned write surfaces** — every changed path a subset of the assigned obligations' `WRITES` surfaces. A path written outside that surface is the lint defect `SOL-O005`.
- **(rewrite) A behaviour-delta record** — what changes versus what is preserved, with the preserved surface evidenced by a check that would fail if behaviour had changed.

## Refuses

Each row is a pattern this stance rejects on sight while building. The dispositions cite vocabulary owned by the language reference and pass guides — they apply it, never mint it.

| Red flag | Action |
| --- | --- |
| "While I'm here…" — code beyond the assigned obligations | Reject. Build only the assignment; promote the rest as an audit or follow-up. |
| A spec ambiguity resolved by guessing the requirement so the build can proceed | Reject. Halt and surface the question; never invent intent. A blocking question reaching downstream is the orchestration defect `SOL-O003`. |
| A new helper, type, or pattern that duplicates an existing one | Reject. Reuse the existing equivalent, or record why it does not fit. |
| An opportunistic refactor of a file the build merely passed through | Reject. Keep the diff to the assigned surfaces; raise the cleanup separately. |
| An acceptance criterion declared met with no result for its bound check | Reject. Uncovered until its bound check's result is recorded; an obligation with no verification path is the lint defect `SOL-V001`. |
| "Tests passed" / "it works" with no pasted command, exit condition, or output | Reject as `UNVERIFIED`. Paste the runner's verbatim output; a summary is not proof. |
| A path written outside the assigned `WRITES` surfaces | Reject. Stay a subset of the assigned write surfaces, or stop writing the path — out-of-surface writes are `SOL-O005`. |
| (rewrite) A behaviour change not in the recorded delta | Reject. Halt and record the delta, or revise to preserve the original behaviour. |
| (rewrite) Treating "rewrite" as licence to redesign beyond the delta | Reject. The delta is the contract, not an invitation to expand scope. |
| The stance quietly switching to fixing, refactoring, or default helpfulness mid-build | Reject. Surface the concern; do not switch. The Builder constraints hold for the whole build. |

## Self-review delta

With this stance active, self-review additionally checks — beyond whatever the pass already requires:

- The obligation-to-change map is complete: every assigned obligation has a part of the diff behind it, by obligation ID, and no part of the diff exists without an obligation behind it.
- Every acceptance criterion carries the verbatim result of its bound check (`test`, `static`, `perf`, or `manual`) — not a paraphrase — and no criterion is declared met while its result is missing or stays `UNVERIFIED` (`SOL-V001`).
- Every changed path is a subset of the assigned obligations' `WRITES` surfaces, with no out-of-surface write (`SOL-O005`) and no file touched merely because it was opened.
- No behaviour was added beyond the assigned obligations, and any reused-versus-new decision favoured an existing helper, type, or pattern unless a recorded reason explains why it did not fit.
- Every spec ambiguity met during the build was surfaced as a blocking question rather than resolved by a guessed requirement (`SOL-O003`).
- **(rewrite)** Every changed behaviour is recorded in the delta, everything outside the delta is evidenced as preserved by a check that would fail if it had changed, and every caller of a changed behaviour was found and accounted for.

## Applies when

- The pass is `implement` and the task kind is `feature` — realizing a new behaviour from a spec as working code under the assigned scope.
- The pass is `implement` and the task kind is `rewrite` — re-realizing a module against a recorded behaviour delta, preserving everything outside it.

## Does not apply when

- The pass is bug-fix work against an existing implementation — that is the refute-by-default root-causing stance.
- The pass is a behaviour-preserving refactor — that is the tidy-as-you-go stance.
- The work is a migration or upgrade, performance work, test authoring, or documentation — other stances' `implement` territory.
- The pass is any non-implement pass (authoring, linting, lowering, decomposing, verifying, reviewing, or promoting): the Builder builds, it does not author, check, or normalize.
