# Task: {{title}}

## Parent contract

<The inherited hand-off contract: objective + deliverable + acceptance bar + boundaries (owned vs forbidden paths).>

| Field           | Value |
| --------------- | ----- |
| Objective       |       |
| Deliverable     |       |
| Acceptance bar  |       |
| Owned paths     |       |
| Forbidden paths |       |

## Scope

<An explicit In / Out list bounding the pass.>

### In

-

### Out

- Do not implement unassigned obligations.
- Do not change behavior outside the assigned write surfaces.
- Do not weaken constraints, invariants, or non-goals.

## Assigned obligations

Paste the exact assigned SOL blocks here, verbatim.

## Constraints and invariants

Paste all constraints and invariants this task must preserve.

## Implementation or pass trace

<What changed, per obligation.>

| Obligation / target | Files changed | How satisfied |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|                     |               |               |

## Verification matrix

<Required proof -> actual proof -> 7-value status, per obligation.>

| Obligation / C / I | Required proof | Actual proof | Status |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ------ |
|                    |                |              | PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED / UNVERIFIED |

## Promotion queue

<Discoveries with target + promotion status (see the `promote` pass); all MUST be resolved before task close.>

| Item | Target | Status |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
|      |        | pending / promoted / deferred / rejected / blocked / validated / rolled-back |

## Self-review

<The structured self-review block: did I do only this pass; preserve semantics; map every claim to evidence.>

<self_review>

- Did I perform only the assigned pass?
- Did I preserve all assigned SOL semantics?
- Did I map every completion claim to evidence?
- Did I avoid changes outside the declared write surfaces?
- Did I resolve every promotion item?
- What remains BLOCKED or UNVERIFIED?

</self_review>
