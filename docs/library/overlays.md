# Overlays — project-local rule bundles

> Swarm's reference for **overlays**: the optional, project-scoped bundles of non-kernel rules a repository layers onto the kernel — architecture conventions, extra refusals, local command bindings — without forking it; how an overlay composes with pass guides and profiles; and the hard boundary that an overlay MAY add project rules but MUST NOT override an approved obligation or the kernel's language semantics.

An **overlay** is the project-scoped guidance layer of the Swarm kernel. Where a pass guide documents *how* to perform one of the nine passes, and a heuristic profile documents *what an agent looks for and refuses* while performing a pass, an overlay documents *what this one project additionally expects* on top of both. It is how a repository encodes its house rules — its architecture conventions, its testing policy, its domain refusals, its local command bindings — without editing or forking the kernel that ships those passes and profiles.

Like every Swarm artifact, an overlay is **markdown-only** and has no runtime: it is a guidance file a human or an agent reads while performing a pass, never shipped code. The kernel's overlay directory is `kernel/.agents/overlays/`; the standard library ships it empty, because the kernel is complete without any overlay at all.

## What an overlay is

An overlay is an **OPTIONAL, project-scoped bundle of non-kernel rules**. Three properties define it:

- **Optional.** A conformant repository MAY ship zero overlays. Overlays add project-specific expectations; they are never required for the kernel, a pass, or a profile to be well-defined. The standard library ships none.
- **Project-scoped.** An overlay carries guidance the kernel deliberately does not ship — convention specific to one repository. It is the canonical home for the kind of rule that is true here but would be wrong to bake into the shared kernel.
- **Non-kernel.** An overlay's rules are project convention. They never define or redefine anything the kernel owns (see [The boundary](#the-boundary)).

Typical overlay content:

| Overlay carries… | Example |
|---|---|
| **Architecture conventions** | "New HTTP handlers register through the `router/` table, never inline in `main`." |
| **Testing policy** | "Every `task_kind: fix` ships a regression test that fails before the fix." |
| **Extra refusals** | "Refuse to bind a new third-party dependency without an ADR." |
| **Local command bindings** | "In this repo, the integration suite is `make itest`; name it where a pass needs it." |
| **Domain / house rules** | "Money is always minor units (integer cents); reject float currency in any spec." |

Overlays are the canonical re-home for legacy architecture and testing-policy "skills." Those were never pass guides — they document no pass — and never profiles — they carry no cognitive stance. They encode project-local convention, and that is exactly what an overlay is for. Keeping them as overlays prevents one repository's house rules from contaminating the shared standard-library pass guides.

## The overlay contract

Every overlay is a `*.md` file (or a directory of them) under `kernel/.agents/overlays/<name>/`, declaring this frontmatter and these four sections:

```markdown
---
type: overlay
name: <name>
version: 0.1.0
---

# Overlay: <name>

## Purpose
<the one project concern this overlay addresses, single clause>

## Applies to
<the passes, task_kinds, paths, or layers this overlay's rules govern>

## Rules
<the project-specific guidance, as an enumerated list>

## Rationale
<why this project holds these rules; never a restatement of kernel semantics>
```

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| `## Purpose` | The single project concern the overlay exists to serve. One overlay, one concern. |
| `## Applies to` | The scope — which passes, `task_kind`s, paths, or layers the overlay's rules act as guidance under. This scope is what lets the overlay compose narrowly rather than apply everywhere. |
| `## Rules` | The enumerated project-specific rules: architecture, testing, and domain conventions, and nothing the kernel owns. |
| `## Rationale` | Why the project holds these rules, stated inline — never a restatement of a kernel definition. |

## How an overlay composes

An overlay is the most downstream object in the kernel's one-way, acyclic dependency chain:

```text
language definitions → artifact contracts → pass contracts → pass guides → heuristic profiles → project overlays
```

It sits *downstream of every kernel object*: it consumes language, artifact, pass, pass-guide, and profile contracts, and is consumed by nothing. Concretely, that means:

- **An overlay composes with a pass guide additively.** The pass guide supplies the procedure for the pass; the overlay adds the project's extra expectations *for that pass*, scoped by its `## Applies to`. The pass guide still owns *how* the pass runs.
- **An overlay composes with a profile additively.** The profile supplies the cognitive stance; the overlay adds project-specific things to look for or refuse on top. The profile still owns the stance.
- **Overlays MAY depend on any upstream node** — they may cite, link, or quote a language definition, an artifact contract, a pass contract, a pass guide, or a profile.
- **Nothing depends on an overlay.** An overlay MUST NOT introduce a back-edge into the chain: it MUST NOT be required to interpret SOL, and MUST NOT be named as a dependency of a pass guide, a profile, or a pass contract. Naming an overlay as upstream of any of those is malformed.

### Lazy activation by name

An overlay is **lazily loaded by name** — exactly like a pass guide or a profile, and for the same reason. A `task.md` names the overlay (or overlays) whose rules apply to its pass; only the named overlays load. Description-matching is the degraded fallback when a task fails to name one. An overlay MUST NOT be always-loaded. This keeps the active context to the pass guide, the profile, and the named overlays the work in front of the agent actually requires — not the union of every project rule the repository has ever written.

## The boundary

An overlay's whole purpose is to *add* project rules. The boundary is that it may add but may never override. An overlay is **purely additive guidance**; it never weakens, waives, or reinterprets anything the kernel marks authoritative. Stated as hard rules, an overlay:

- **MUST NOT define or redefine SOL or APS semantics.** The language belongs to the kernel.
- **MUST NOT define or redefine a kernel object** — a block type (one of the 7 blocks), a modal (one of the 5 modals), a verdict value (one of the 7 verdicts), a proof type (one of the 9 proof types), or a lint code (`SOL-<LAYER>NNN`).
- **MUST NOT override an approved obligation.** An overlay adds project expectations; it never relaxes, waives, or reinterprets an obligation the spec already approved. Waiver authority stays with a human or the spec owner — never an overlay.
- **MUST NOT be always-loaded.** It loads lazily by name, as above.

The reason the boundary is restated this sharply is that the overlay is the layer most tempting to abuse as a back door for project-local semantics — the place a repository would be tempted to quietly redefine a modal or weaken a verdict under the cover of "house rules." It cannot. An overlay is **SOFT control**: its rules are guidance for a model, not enforcement, and they bind nothing the kernel marks authoritative. A conformant repository confirms that no overlay defines or overrides any of the kernel objects enumerated above — the same regression check that confirms no skill, profile, or `AGENTS.md` section has smuggled in modality, authority order, or verification semantics, extended to cover overlays.

The clean way to read the boundary: if a rule changes *what this project additionally expects*, it is an overlay rule; if it changes *what the words mean or what counts as done*, it belongs to the kernel and an amendment, not an overlay.

## Where overlays live

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `kernel/.agents/overlays/` | The overlay directory. The standard library ships it empty (with a README); a project populates it. |
| `kernel/.agents/overlays/<name>/` | One overlay — a `*.md` file or a directory of them, per [the contract](#the-overlay-contract). |
