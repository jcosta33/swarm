# Saving findings

*Works today — plain markdown plus your agent; no Corpus tooling required.*

Close is the loop's last step. The merge happened. The review packet records what was
verified. What's left is the part most teams skip: keeping what the work taught you. A
session ends and its context evaporates. Anything not written to a file is gone. Writing
intermediate state to durable files measurably helps multi-step work, and is the recommended
pattern for work that spans sessions
[[CTXENG]](research/sources.md#CTXENG) [[SCRATCHPAD]](research/sources.md#SCRATCHPAD).

## The honest weakness

A hand-edited board and a findings folder are willpower in markdown — the discipline wikis die
of. Two structural prompts keep the habit from being bare. The review packet routes **new
finding candidates** as an exception class, so the reviewer sees them. The agent guides end every
task with "anything learned worth saving as a finding." A future `swarm close` will prompt for
both. Until then this is a convention, and saying so beats pretending otherwise.

## The one rule

> **Before closing a task, record anything durable as a finding.**

This is a convention — nothing in this repo enforces it. It costs one short file in
`findings/`, written from the frozen template at
[`templates/finding.md`](https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm-starter-kit/blob/main/templates/finding.md): what we learned,
the evidence, where it applies, where it does not, what to do differently next time. The task
packet's Findings section is the staging area. At Close, anything sitting there moves to
`findings/` or gets dropped deliberately.

## What counts as a finding

Durable means _the next task would want to know this_:

- **provider quirks** — "the payments sandbox rate-limits at 10 rps; the docs say 100"
- **hidden contracts** — "the export job assumes `user.email` is never null"
- **decisions** — "we retry idempotent calls only; rationale in the review packet" (a
  decision big enough to outlive one feature graduates to an ADR in `decisions/`)
- **gotchas** — "the test suite passes locally with a stale fixture; regenerate first"

What does **not** count: run logs, transcripts, "the tests passed" (that lives in the review
packet), local environment details, anything you'd never grep for again. A finding states one
claim. Writing three? Write three findings.

## How findings come back

There is no retrieval engine. Findings return through two cheap channels:

- **the board** — `status.md` lists findings pending acceptance, so they get read and either
  accepted or marked stale instead of rotting;
- **grep** — findings are plain markdown with real words in them; "what do we know about the
  payments sandbox?" is one search away. Write titles you would search for.

When the next spec or task touches the same area, link the finding in its sources. That is the
whole feedback loop: lessons from one task become input to the next.

## Update the board

Close ends with a board update in `status.md`
([template](https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm-starter-kit/blob/main/templates/status.md)). Mark the task closed.
Link its review packet. List the new finding as pending acceptance. Refresh the Human attention
list (blocking questions on draft specs · tasks with no review packet · findings pending
acceptance). One honest rule, at checklist level: **a "verified" or "done" claim on the board
links its review packet.** A board of unlinked "done" rows is a wish list, not a status.

The board is hand-edited and stays small. `swarm status` prints the derived board today. Deriving
full per-spec requirement coverage from the review packets is the deferred coverage engine; for
now the board is the hand-kept summary.

## When you outgrow this

A `findings/` folder plus grep carries a team surprisingly far. Teams with hundreds of findings,
multiple repos, or recurring cross-feature patterns adopt the advanced memory model: a load-when
index, a glossary, and patterns built from corroborated findings. It lives at
[`reference/memory.md`](reference/memory.md). Adopt it when grep stops being enough, not before.

That's the loop closed: [pull the next piece of work](02-basic-workflow.md).
