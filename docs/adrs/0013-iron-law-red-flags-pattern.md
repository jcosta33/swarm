# ADR 0013: Iron-law + red-flags persona format

## Status

Superseded by [0036](./0036-heuristic-profile-model.md) — the iron law is recast as a profile's `## Refuses` red-flag table (§27.2). The original decision text below is kept as history (Nygard, §30.1: an accepted ADR is never edited in place; only this status line is added).

## Context

Soft guidance bullet lists degrade under LLM optimisation — models reinterpret "should avoid" as "unless inconvenient".

Borrowing clarity from hostile-review pattern libraries, Suspec personas pair **Hard constraints / Forbidden actions** (**iron-law style absolutes**) with explicit **Red flags** tables mapping rationalisations to refusals.

## Decision

Canonical persona payloads live inside the seven individual persona skills at `/scaffold/.agents/skills/persona-<slug>/SKILL.md` (architect, auditor, janitor, migrator, performance-surgeon, skeptic, surveyor) — not a single consolidated `personas/SKILL.md`. Each refined persona body uses the fixed shape **Role / Mindset / Hard constraints / Forbidden actions / Red flags / Persona discipline**: the iron-law absolutes land in *Hard constraints* and *Forbidden actions*, the rationalisation→refusal table is the *Red flags* section, and *Persona discipline* is the cross-cutting guard against softening or persona-switching mid-task. Documentation **explains** why this shape works (see `docs/concepts/04-personas.md`).

## Consequences

- Positive: mechanistic refusal of comforting shortcuts; aligns with empirical gates.
- Negative: verbosity — compensated by skim-friendly TL;DR at each profile head.
