# Architecture Decision Records (framework)

Lightweight decisions behind Swarm's load-bearing conventions. Each ADR captures **context**, **decision**, and **consequences** so forks can judge whether the choice still fits.

Older exploratory specs (merged into `/docs`) referred to decisions by number; those references resolve here.

Numbers **0011 and 0012 are intentionally vacant** — they were vacated during an earlier consolidation and are left unfilled for historical continuity, so existing references to higher numbers don't shift.
