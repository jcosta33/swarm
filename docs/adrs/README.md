# Architecture Decision Records (Swarm kernel)

Each ADR is a dated, immutable record of one load-bearing decision — its **context**, the **decision**, and its **consequences** — so a fork can judge whether the choice still fits. The full truth of any decision is the **chain** of ADRs that touch it, not the latest one alone.

This ledger is the index. It carries a row for **every** ADR — kept, amended, already-superseded, and new — with its current disposition (§30 of the kernel spec).

## Governance (Nygard immutability, §30.1)

> An accepted ADR **MUST NOT** be edited in place. "Amending" a decision means publishing a **new, superseding ADR**; the original keeps its body and gains only a `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` status line. Rewriting an ADR destroys the historical record that makes the chain auditable.

Two consequences of that rule govern this ledger:

- **Numbers `0011` and `0012` are intentionally vacant** — vacated in an earlier consolidation and left unfilled so references to higher numbers do not shift.
- **The pre-kernel ADRs (`0001`–`0026`) are immutable history.** Their bodies still name the pre-kernel vocabulary and paths (`scaffold/`, `personas/`, the consolidated `SKILL.md`, the earlier flow-graph) **as they were decided**. Those bodies are *not* subject to the kernel's active-construct rules (the §34 / A19–A28 retirements) — those rules govern canonical/active prose, not the historical record. The **current** truth of any amended decision is its superseding `0027+` ADR; read the chain, not the earlier body in isolation.

Orthogonal to `parallel_group`; `isolation:`/`base:` frame fields override | **New (kernel)** — §18; **refines** [0039](./0039-write-surface-model.md); operationalizes [0010](./0010-write-side-single-threaded.md) |

## The new kernel ADRs (0027+), by topic

The rework introduced sixteen ADRs. The nine the spec enumerates as mandatory kernel decisions (§30.3) record decisions that must not be left implicit in prose:

| ADR | Records | Spec |
|-----|---------|------|
| [0027](./0027-sol-is-the-obligation-language.md) | SOL is the single home of obligation semantics | §5, §6 |
| [0028](./0028-aps-is-the-prose-standard.md) | APS is the controlled-prose standard around SOL | §7 |
| [0029](./0029-nine-pass-compiler-model.md) | `author → lint → improve → lower → decompose → implement → verify → review → promote` | §9 |
| [0030](./0030-unified-artifact-set.md) | the kernel artifact set incl. trace, VERDICT block, finding, memory | §20, §29 |
| [0031](./0031-source-authority-two-axis.md) | domain axis × artifact axis, lexicographic | §22 |
| [0032](./0032-memory-model.md) | two-tier, provenance-anchored promotion | §23 |
| [0033](./0033-golden-corpus.md) | positive + negative conformance fixtures over the three domains | §33 |
| [0034](./0034-unified-lint-namespace.md) | one prefix, five layers; APS violations surface under the `SOL-` prefix, not a separate `APS-` code prefix | §8 |
| [0035](./0035-seven-value-verdict-model.md) | 4 core + 3 lifecycle verdicts | §14 |

The remaining seven carry the Group-B recasts, the kernel-rename/versioning extensions, and the skill-carrier packaging refinement: [0036](./0036-heuristic-profile-model.md) (profiles, §27), [0037](./0037-load-what-the-task-names.md) (loading doctrine, §26.4), [0038](./0038-verify-by-adapters-through-commands.md) (the `VERIFY BY`/Commands binding, §15/§31.3), [0039](./0039-write-surface-model.md) (the write-surface, §18/§19), [0040](./0040-kernel-payload-directory.md) (the `kernel/` payload, §20.5/§34), [0041](./0041-two-axis-versioning.md) (two-axis versioning, §25), and [0042](./0042-skill-carrier-and-standalone-conditioning.md) (skills carry as `SKILL.md` + standalone surgically-activated conditioning, §26/§27; refines [0016](./0016-skills-are-self-contained.md), [0017](./0017-no-always-load-skills.md), [0019](./0019-personas-ship-as-individual-skills.md), [0029](./0029-nine-pass-compiler-model.md), [0036](./0036-heuristic-profile-model.md), [0037](./0037-load-what-the-task-names.md)).

A conformant repo MUST carry these ADRs (or equivalents) so the chain explains why the obligation language, prose standard, pipeline, artifact set, authority model, memory, corpus, lint namespace, and verdict set have their shape.

[0043](./0043-checkable-documents.md) is **proposed / parked** — it records a *direction* (keep obligation-blocks spec-only; give other agent docs a subtractive, deterministic, advisory check surface) but builds no lint rule and changes nothing in the live lint pass. It is design intent, not an in-force decision; the backlog is in `.agents/lintable-docs-improvement-plan.md`.

[0044](./0044-kernel-is-derived-and-self-contained.md) settles the shape of the installable payload: `docs/` is the **single canonical source** for the `language/` and `passes/` twins and the kernel is a **derived, checked, self-contained copy** that resolves offline (no `§N`/`Appendix-X` refs to unshipped documents, no links into docs-only trees). The kernel is derived by mechanical rewrites (strip citations/§-refs, rewrite links to resolve offline) and kept honest by an eyeball-diff on edit + a grep-based coherence gate — refining the kernel-payload decision ([0040](./0040-kernel-payload-directory.md)). The one-time reconciling merge it authorized (the K2 work) is done.
