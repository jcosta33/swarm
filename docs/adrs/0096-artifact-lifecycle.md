# ADR-0096 — Artifact lifecycle at scale: durable-vs-ephemeral records, status + supersede, retention, freshness, and anti-duplication

## Context

After hundreds of specs over years, do review files live forever? How do artifacts coexist and stay
findable? A web-verified evidence pass (swarm-hq #54; sources below, each verified June 2026 with
honest tiers) gives a principled lifecycle drawn from records-management and large-org documentation
practice.

- **Durable vs ephemeral has a principled test.** A record is durable when it is "evidence of
  decision-making"; transitory records are "routine records of short-term value (generally less than
  ~180 days)," disposed of when no longer needed ([[NARAGRS52]] — not a hard cutoff). The
  records lifecycle is appraisal → a **retention schedule** → disposition (retain / transfer /
  archive / destroy) ([[ISO15489]]). CI/run artifacts are ephemeral by industry default — GitHub
  Actions retains them **90 days**, GitLab **30** ([[GHRETENTION]]).
- **Decisions supersede, never rewrite.** ADRs are numbered sequentially with no reuse, carry a
  **status**, and a reversed decision is *kept and marked superseded with a pointer to its
  replacement* — not altered or deleted ([[NYGARDADR]]); the `NNNN-title.md` + status pattern scales
  to thousands per repo ([[MADR]]).
- **Write-once fails at scale; the dominant failure is duplication.** ~29% of the most-popular GitHub
  projects currently carry an outdated doc reference ([[DOCROT]]); "documents without owners become
  stale," freshness reminders help (a ~3-month example), and at scale a dominant failure mode is
  **duplication, not just absence** (the Borg case: 7–10 overlapping docs, no owner) ([[SWEGBOOKDOCS]]).

swarm's `docs/adrs/` already numbers sequentially and its ADR frontmatter already carries
`status`/`supersedes`/`superseded_by` — so the decision lifecycle is half-convention already; the
gap is stating it, extending it to specs, and adding the durable/ephemeral + retention + freshness
layer.

## Decision

1. **Durable-vs-ephemeral is a first-class rule** (`docs/03-where-files-live.md`, convention).
   **Durable records** — decisions (ADRs), specs of record, saved findings — persist for the repo's
   life and **supersede-not-delete**. **Transitory output** — review packets, `swarm check` output,
   run logs — ages out: keep it in git history (the default archive) or an `archive/` directory, with
   a retention window in the **30–90-day band** (anchored to GitHub 90 / GitLab 30 [[GHRETENTION]],
   not an invented number). *Level: convention.* ([[NARAGRS52]], [[ISO15489]])

2. **Status lifecycle + supersede pointer on decisions and specs** (convention, with a named toolable).
   Status is `proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded-by-NNNN`; the artifact is kept and only
   its status changes; numbers are sequential and never reused ([[NYGARDADR]], [[MADR]]). A
   **`swarm check` is *specified* (toolable, in the spirit of C015): every `superseded_by` pointer
   resolves to an existing artifact, and the index lists it** — *named here, not shipped; the swarm-cli
   agent mints the contract entry + implementation* (no `checks.yaml` change lands with this ADR, to
   avoid contract/impl drift; tracked in swarm-hq #61 §B). *Level: convention now, toolable when the
   check ships.*

3. **Freshness + named ownership for durable artifacts** (convention). A durable spec/ADR/finding
   names an **owner**, and durable docs carry a freshness review window (a ~3-month example, presented
   as convention not a measured optimum) ([[SWEGBOOKDOCS]]; [[DOCROT]] is the warrant that write-once
   rots). *Level: convention.*

3.5. **Single-sourcing is the anti-duplication control** (reinforces the existing rule, MUST-level by
   convention). One canonical home per rule/decision; "no canonical owner" is a reviewable defect, and
   the failure to guard against is **duplication, not absence** ([[SWEGBOOKDOCS]] Borg). *Level:
   convention (the existing single-sourcing rule, sharpened).*

4. **A generated index/board is the discoverability surface** (convention — the weakest-evidence leg,
   labeled as such). A flat per-type folder + a board carrying `ID · title · status · supersedes/
   superseded-by` keeps hundreds of artifacts navigable by search-over-a-flat-list. *Level: convention.*

## Consequences

- No `checks.yaml` rule and no contract-version bump land here: the supersede/index check is
  specified-not-shipped (swarm-cli follow-up, #61), consistent with the honesty framework (ADR-0063).
- Retention/freshness numbers are anchored, never invented: the 30–90-day band cites GitHub/GitLab,
  the ~180-day transitory bound and the ~3-month freshness reminder are cited as *typical/example*,
  not rules ([[NARAGRS52]], [[SWEGBOOKDOCS]]).
- Scope honesty travels with the citations: [[DOCROT]] is scoped to top-by-stars + Google repos;
  [[ISO15489]] is paywalled (cited by catalog identity + verified clause text); "immutable" is not
  attributed to [[NYGARDADR]] (his words are keep-and-mark-superseded).

## Propagation

`docs/03-where-files-live.md` (the durable/ephemeral + retention + lifecycle + freshness + index
rules), `docs/research/sources.md` (the seven entries above), and the starter kit (an `archive/`
convention + `status`/`supersedes` columns in the board). The `superseded_by`-resolves /
index-lists `swarm check` is the toolable follow-up (swarm-hq #61 §B), not shipped by this ADR.
