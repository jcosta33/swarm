# ADR-0085 — swarm-mcp adapts the CLI's `--json` contract (shells out), not the core library

## Context

ADR-0077 (the reconcile-only harness) and `future-cli.md` § "Beyond the loop" sketch a **Swarm MCP
server** that exposes the task packet's scope, parsed requirements, and the checks contract to any
MCP-capable agent — described there as *reusing the reconcile-only core library without shelling out*.
When the MCP server (`swarm-mcp`, a sibling package — the family's "many libraries, not a framework"
shape) was actually built, the opposite coupling was chosen: it **shells out** to the `swarm` CLI's
public `--json` contract rather than importing swarm-cli's internals. This ADR records that deviation
so it is explicit, not silent (the implementing review flagged that an ADR was owed).

## Decision

`swarm-mcp` is a **thin MCP stdio adapter over the `swarm` CLI's `--json` interface**. It spawns
`swarm <cmd> --json` with a fixed argv array (a controlled subprocess — never a shell string, never a
client-injected flag) and reshapes the output into MCP tools/resources/prompts. It **does not import
swarm-cli's Core**. The two repos couple only through the public, tested `--json` contract.

Why this over ADR-0077's "reuse the core library" sketch:

1. **Footprint.** The MCP SDK pulls ~16 transitive dependencies; keeping it in a separate package
   preserves swarm-cli's deliberate 2-runtime-dependency minimalism — every CLI user would otherwise
   pay an 8× dependency tax for a server they may never run.
2. **"Many libraries, nothing entirely depends on anything else."** A tool coupled through another's
   public JSON interface does not *entirely depend on* it; importing the core library would tie
   swarm-mcp to internal module shapes that are not a stable library API.
3. **Parse in one place (no drift).** All Swarm semantics stay in swarm-cli Core, surfaced as `--json`;
   swarm-mcp re-parses nothing. A zod **drift tripwire** in swarm-mcp guards the consumed shapes, so a
   CLI change fails a test rather than silently producing wrong output.
4. The read surface swarm-cli grows to feed this (a `swarm show <task|spec|review|checks> --json`
   family, wrapping parsers that already exist) is **independently useful** — scriptable reads in their
   own right.

## Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Why weaker |
|---|---|
| **Import the reconcile-only core library** (ADR-0077's sketch) | Couples swarm-mcp to swarm-cli's *internal* modules (no published, stable library API today), pulls swarm-cli + its tree as a dependency, and ties their versions. The public `--json` contract is the looser, already-tested seam. Rejected for v0; revisitable if a `swarm-core` library is ever extracted. |
| **Build the MCP server inside swarm-cli** | Imposes the MCP SDK's ~16-dep, 8× footprint expansion on every swarm-cli install, and introduces a persistent event-loop process model into an otherwise request-response CLI. Rejected — it taxes users who never use MCP and dilutes the footprint that is part of swarm-cli's identity. |
| **Extract a shared `swarm-core` package now** | The cleanest long-term coupling, but a premature, large refactor before the MCP value is proven. Deferred. |

## Consequences

Accepted. **Refines ADR-0077 D1a**: the MCP server adapts the CLI's `--json` contract rather than
importing the core library. swarm-cli stays read/reconcile-only and minimal-footprint, and grows a
small, independently-useful `swarm show … --json` read family (the loader surface the MCP needs).
`swarm-mcp` is its own package, independently versioned, carrying the MCP SDK's dependencies alone. The
reconcile-only boundary (ADR-0077 D8) holds end to end — swarm-mcp issues no verdict and writes nothing;
it relays the CLI's facts (and the human-recorded board state) verbatim under a `noVerdictIssued`
guarantee. Neutral: one subprocess per tool call (acceptable for interactive single-agent use; the
synchronous `spawnSync` blocks the event loop during each ~tens-of-ms call — a recorded v0 limitation,
a candidate async refactor if concurrency is ever needed). Honors ADR-0063 (the adapter claims a level,
never enforcement).
