# The SOL Grammar — Consolidated EBNF Reference

> Swarm's single formal grammar for the SOL surface language: the complete EBNF for everything you write inside a `*.swarm.md` file, the lint constraints attached to each production, and the v0.1 rules for opacity and deferral.

This page is the **complete, formal grammar** for SOL (the Swarm Obligation Language) — the human-authored `.swarm.md` surface syntax. A conformant `.swarm.md` parser MUST accept exactly the language this grammar generates and MUST reject any input outside it. Where [SOL.md](SOL.md) *teaches* the surface with prose, tables, and worked examples, this page is the **lossless reference**: every production, in one place, with no narrative gaps.

It is **markdown-only and provider-neutral**: nothing here is shipped code. A "parser" is the contract a future tool builds against; this repository runs no parser, linter, or lowering step. The grammar is the contract; the tool, when it exists, conforms to it.

This grammar consolidates and supersedes three earlier competing surface shapes from the research corpus — the fenced `:::TYPE …:::END` form, the significant-indentation `Indent`/`Dedent` form, and the colon-less header form. Each of those is **non-conformant**; this EBNF is the only normative shape. *Design rationale:* one greppable surface, machine-detectable inside free Markdown, with no construct a Markdown renderer can reflow away.

---

## 1. The surface-vs-IR layering (read this first)

There is one master layering of the language, and this page describes only one half of it.

- **Surface** — what a human writes — is **English-shaped UPPERCASE keywords** (`VERIFY BY`, `DEPENDS ON`, `OWNED BY`). This grammar is the surface.
- **IR** — what a tool *emits*, never authored — is **snake_case fields** (`verify_by`, `depends_on`, `owner`).

The EBNF below is the human surface; it never describes the IR. Wherever a surface keyword appears here, the corresponding snake_case field is reserved for the IR layer and MUST NOT appear at the surface. The IR envelope is specified separately in [the IR schema](../reference/ir-schema.md); this separation is one of the framework's load-bearing invariants. Keywords are UPPERCASE and case-sensitive; lowercase `must`/`should`/`may` and lowercase keywords carry no force and are parsed as prose.

---

## 2. The line-oriented model

The grammar is **line-oriented**. A block is a bare header line `TYPE PREFIX-NNN:` followed by contiguous non-blank body lines, terminated by the next block header, a blank line, or a Markdown heading (`#`). There is **no closing delimiter and no significant indentation**.

In v0.1 the arguments of conditions (`WHERE`/`WHILE`/`WHEN`/`IF`) are **opaque text** (`condition_text` below): the structured expression sublanguage and the timing keywords (`WITHIN`, `BEFORE`, `UNTIL`, `IMMEDIATELY`, `EVENTUALLY`) are deferred to v0.2. The opacity and deferral rules are normative and appear in full in §4.

---

## 3. Normative EBNF

This is the single normative grammar for the SOL surface syntax. The IR/JSON layer is not specified here (see [the IR schema](../reference/ir-schema.md)); surface keywords are space-separated uppercase, IR fields are snake_case.

## 4. Opacity and deferral (normative for v0.1)

These rules are part of the grammar's contract. A conformant parser MUST honor them.

1. **Opaque single-line text.** `condition_text`, `question_text`, `response`, `hold_text`, and `prose_text` are opaque single-line text in v0.1. No structured expression grammar (operators, comparisons, `AND`/`OR`) is defined; a parser MUST NOT attempt to tokenize their interior. The expression sublanguage is deferred to v0.2.
2. **Timing keywords are deferred.** `WITHIN`, `BEFORE`, `UNTIL`, `IMMEDIATELY`, `EVENTUALLY` are **not productions in this grammar**; they are reserved for v0.2 (FRETish temporal semantics). Their appearance in a `.swarm.md` is parsed as opaque prose and SHOULD raise an advisory pointing to the deferral.
3. **Removed legacy keywords.** `ALWAYS`/`NEVER` (legacy INVARIANT openers), `EXPOSES`/`INPUT`/`OUTPUT` (legacy INTERFACE), and `MAP`/`TO`/`ORDER`/`ASK` (legacy TASK-MAP/QUESTION) are removed and have no production; they MUST be rejected.
4. **`THEN` placement.** `THEN` is legal only as the optional trailing sugar of `if_clause`; after `WHEN`/`WHILE` it MUST be rejected as a parse error.
5. **Indentation is non-semantic.** A block body **clause** line MAY carry leading whitespace; that whitespace is stripped before the line is matched against its body production. Block **headers** (`req_header`, `constraint_header`, … and `surface_decl`) MUST remain flush-left (no leading whitespace). The `[ ws ]` allowance applies only to body clause lines.
6. **SOL has no comment token.** There is no `comment` production anywhere in this grammar. `#` is reserved exclusively for the `cross_spec_ref` separator (`spec_id#id`) and the `verify_ref` `#selector`. A trailing or standalone `# …` annotation is therefore **not** part of the language; any `# …` annotation surrounding an example is editorial marginalia, not a parseable line a conformant parser admits.
7. **Opaque-text line continuation.** Where a clause's value is opaque text (`condition_text`, `question_text`, `response`, `hold_text`, `prose_text` — note 1; in particular a `REASON` line's `prose_text` in `verdict_body`), a following physical line that does **not** begin with a recognized keyword (a block header, a clause keyword such as `EVIDENCE`/`AFFECTS`/`VERIFY BY`, or a metadata field) is a **continuation** of the preceding clause: it is joined to that clause's opaque text (with a single separating space) before matching. This is why a `VERDICT`'s `REASON` may wrap across two physical lines while `verdict_body` shows `REASON` as a single logical clause. The continuation joins text only; it never introduces structure (no expression grammar — note 1).

---

## 5. Lint constraints attached to grammar productions

Each grammar production carries one or more well-formedness checks from the unified lint namespace `SOL-<LAYER><NNN>`. A `SOL-S###` code is raised when the input cannot be parsed by the production; a `SOL-P###`/`SOL-V###` code is raised when the input parses but violates a higher-layer rule. The full catalogue lives on the [lint reference](errors.md); the codes below are the subset directly attached to grammar productions.

A note on layering: a missing or malformed proof binding (`VERIFY BY`) and a malformed `VERDICT` value are **verification** defects, not parse defects, so they carry `SOL-V` codes even though they read like syntax. This is why what looks like "a missing `VERIFY BY`" fires at the verification layer rather than at parse.

| Code | Layer | Severity | Production / trigger | Diagnostic |
|------|-------|----------|----------------------|------------|
| `SOL-S001` | SYNTAX | BLOCKING | `where_clause`/`while_clause`/`when_clause`/`if_clause` present with no following `actor_clause` | Precondition (`WHERE`/`WHILE`/`WHEN`/`IF`) with no actor clause; add `THE <actor> <MODAL> <response>`. |
| `SOL-S002` | SYNTAX | BLOCKING | `block_header` is not one of the 7 block types, or a body line uses an unknown/malformed clause keyword | Unknown block type or clause keyword; use a valid block type / clause keyword. (A trigger with no following `actor_clause` is `SOL-S001`.) |
| `SOL-S003` | SYNTAX | BLOCKING | `actor_clause`/`and_actor_clause` with no `modal` terminal | Actor clause with no modal; use `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, or `MAY` (`SHALL`/`CAN`/`WILL` are not modals). |
| `SOL-S004` | SYNTAX | BLOCKING | Two `block_header` productions share the same `*_id` within one spec file | Duplicate block ID (intra-spec); renumber the second block. (Cross-spec collisions are `SOL-M001`.) |
| `SOL-S011` | SYNTAX | BLOCKING | `block_header` with no `*_id` | Missing obligation ID after the block type; add `PREFIX-NNN:`. |
| `SOL-S005` | SYNTAX | BLOCKING | `*_id` prefix does not match `block_header` type (e.g. `CONSTRAINT AC-001:`) | ID prefix/block-type mismatch; `REQ→AC-`, `CONSTRAINT→C-`, `INVARIANT→I-`, `INTERFACE→IF-`, `QUESTION→Q-`, `TRACE→T-`. |
| `SOL-S006` | SYNTAX | BLOCKING | `actor_clause` modal is `SHOULD`/`SHOULD NOT` with no `because_clause` or `except_clause` in the same block | `SHOULD`/`SHOULD NOT` used without `BECAUSE` or `EXCEPT`. |
| `SOL-P003` | PROSE | BLOCKING | `modal` slot filled by `CAN`/`WILL` or a lowercase/informal modal in a binding clause | Missing or informal modality in a binding clause; use a real uppercase modal. |
| `SOL-P004` | PROSE | BLOCKING / ADVISORY | `req_body`/`constraint_body` bundling separable obligations into one clause (BLOCKING), or more than two chained `and_actor_clause` (ADVISORY warning) | Bundled/overloaded obligation: a single clause carrying multiple separable obligations is BLOCKING (`ATOMIZE`); the *permitted* `AND THE` chain beyond two is a non-blocking warning (lowered to multiple IR obligations). |
| `SOL-V001` | VERIFICATION | BLOCKING | binding obligation (`REQ`/`CONSTRAINT`/`INVARIANT`/`INTERFACE`) with no `verify_line` | Missing `VERIFY BY` for a binding obligation. |
| `SOL-V009` | VERIFICATION | BLOCKING | `verify_ref` whose `proof_type` is outside the closed 9-set | Unknown proof type; use one of `static, test, contract, property, model, perf, security, manual, monitor`. |
| `SOL-V005` | VERIFICATION | BLOCKING | `verdict_value` `verdict_core` outside the four core values, or `verdict_lifecycle` missing a mandatory field | `VERDICT` value outside `PASS`/`FAIL`/`BLOCKED`/`UNVERIFIED`, or a lifecycle decorator missing authority/reason (`WAIVED` also requires expiry). |
| `SOL-V006` | VERIFICATION | BLOCKING | `INTERFACE` `verify_line` whose `proof_type` ≠ `contract` | `INTERFACE` MUST be verified by a `contract:` binding. |

The lint layers are **S/P/M/V/O** (Syntax / Prose / seMantic / Verification / Orchestration). This page reproduces only the production-attached subset; the cross-reference (`SOL-M`) and orchestration (`SOL-O`) layers, the legacy translation table, the severity model, and the diagnostic-record shape are on the [lint reference](errors.md).
