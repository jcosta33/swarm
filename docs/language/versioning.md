# Versioning

> Swarm's reference for versioning: the two independent version axes, the one-way trigger between them, and the three version fields a reader sees in frontmatter and the structured form.

Swarm carries **two independent version axes**. Conflating them is a category error: one tracks the *meaning of the language*, the other tracks *the package that delivers it*. A conformant repo MUST track both and MUST NOT merge them into a single number (§1).

This language is **version 0.1**. The framework package that delivers it carries its own semver, independent of that `0.1`.

A third version — the **spec content version** — is not a system-wide axis but a per-document fact: the semver of *one* spec's intent. It surfaces as its own field in the structured form / plan (§3) and in frontmatter (§4), so a complete count of *fields a reader sees* is **three**, drawn from **two** axes.

## §1 — The two axes

This is the normative labelling convention for both axes — what each one versions, where it is carried, and how fast it moves:

| Axis | What it versions | Carried in | Cadence |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| **Language version** | The SOL + APS feature set: grammar, the 7 block types, the 5 modals, the clause keywords, the `SOL-<LAYER>NNN` lint codes | `*.swarm.md` frontmatter as the discriminator `swarm_language: SOL/0.1` (plus `aps_version`); echoed in the structured form as `meta.language` | Small, slow-moving: `0.1`, `0.2`, `1.0` |
| **Framework / package version** | The starter kit — templates, pass guides, profiles, the flow-graph, and skills that ship together | a **producer release tag** on the `swarm` repo (e.g. a git tag / changelog). An adopted project keeps **no** copy — see ADR-0050 | Ordinary, fast semver; may move many times between language bumps |

(The block-type, modal, and lint-layer counts above are Swarm's fixed vocabulary — 7 block types, 5 modals, 5 lint layers S/P/M/V/O. This page reproduces those counts as labels for the language axis; the vocabulary itself is defined in [`./SOL.md`](./SOL.md) (blocks and modals) and [`./errors.md`](./errors.md) (lint layers).)

### §1.1 — Language version: "which grammar does this file speak?"

The language version answers **"which grammar, blocks, modals, and lint codes does this file speak?"** It is carried **per file**, so a single repo MAY hold `spec.swarm.md` files at different language versions during a migration. Two frontmatter fields carry it:

- `swarm_language` — the **SOL discriminator**, written `SOL/0.1`.
- `aps_version` — the **APS prose-standard version**, written `0.1`.

This document is language `0.1`; later language epochs are `0.2`, then `1.0`.

### §1.2 — Framework / package version: "which starter kit shipped this repo?"

The framework version answers **"which release of the starter kit shipped these templates and pass guides?"** It is a **producer-side release tag** on the `swarm` repo. An adopted project keeps **no** per-repo version file — in a no-runtime, copy-the-files world nothing reads it, and you re-copy the kit to upgrade ([ADR-0050](../adrs/0050-swarm-is-a-spec-repo-discipline.md) §6, refining [ADR-0041](../adrs/0041-two-axis-versioning.md)). It is **never** written in per-file frontmatter (§4). The language axis sits *alongside* the package axis, not in place of it: only the **language** version travels with an adopted repo (in each spec's frontmatter); the package version is the producer's release label.

## §2 — The one-way trigger

The axes are independent, but coupled by exactly **one** directional rule:

> **Any change to the SOL/APS language version MUST force at least a framework MINOR release** — additive language change → framework MINOR; breaking language change → framework MAJOR. The framework MAY release any number of versions (PATCH / MINOR / MAJOR) **without** changing the language version.

```text
language change ──(MUST)──▶ framework MINOR (additive) or MAJOR (breaking)
framework change ──(MAY)──▶ no language change required
```

The rationale: a new keyword or lint code changes what the templates and pass guides must teach, so the package that ships them MUST move; but fixing a template typo or adding a skill never touches the grammar, so the language MUST stay pinned. The trigger runs **one way only** — language ⇒ framework, never framework ⇒ language.

**0.y.z caveat (do not over-read the trigger).** While both axes sit at major-version-zero, semantic versioning holds that *anything MAY change at any time* below `1.0`, so the trigger is **advisory until each axis reaches 1.0**. Even after 1.0 it is a one-directional *floor* — a language change forces at least a framework MINOR — not a promise that every framework release re-issues the language.

## §2.1 — Editions / MSRV analogues

The two-axis split mirrors mature language ecosystems that version the *language* separately from the *toolchain* delivering it — Rust's editions / `rust-version` MSRV / cargo release, and C#'s `LangVersion` (bounded by the installed compiler) — each joined by a one-way constraint, the same shape as Swarm's language ⇒ framework trigger. The takeaway: the *language API* (grammar + lint codes) and the *package API* (template sections + skills + flow-graph) are versioned as **separately-named public APIs**.

## §3 — Three distinct fields in the structured form / plan

The emitted structured form and plan MUST echo **three distinct fields**, and a conformant tool MUST NOT merge any two of them:

| Field | Axis / meaning | Example |
| ----- | -------------- | ------- |
| `meta.language` | The SOL **discriminator** — which grammar this structured form was parsed under | `"SOL/0.1"` |
| `meta.version` | The **spec content version** — the semver of *this spec's intent*, independent of language and framework | `"0.1.0"` |
| `provenance.tool_version` | The **tool version** that emitted the structured form, when a tool exists | `null` / unset today (no runtime) |

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "language": "SOL/0.1",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "title": "auth-refresh"
  },
  "provenance": {
    "tool_version": null
  }
}
```

These answer three different questions — *which grammar* (`meta.language`), *which revision of this spec's intent* (`meta.version`), and *which tool produced this* (`provenance.tool_version`) — and a single number cannot answer all three. `provenance.tool_version` is `null` today because Swarm has no runtime: the parser, linter, and checker are contracts a future tool builds against, never shipped code.

## §4 — G10: canonical frontmatter

To make the three-field mapping unambiguous, Swarm pins **one** frontmatter vocabulary across all `.swarm.md` and template files (rule G10):

```text
---
swarm_language: SOL/0.1   # SOL discriminator (= meta.language in the structured form)
aps_version: 0.1          # APS prose-standard version
spec_version: 0.1.0       # spec content version (= meta.version in the structured form)
---
```

| Frontmatter field | Maps to structured-form field | Axis |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---- |
| `swarm_language: SOL/0.1` | `meta.language` | Language (discriminator) |
| `aps_version: 0.1` | (not echoed in the structured form; governs the `SOL-P…` prose lint layer) | Language |
| `spec_version: 0.1.0` | `meta.version` | Spec content |

**Conformance note.** The canonical form is `swarm_language: SOL/0.1` (with the `SOL/` discriminator) plus a separate `spec_version`. A conformant repo MUST use this form; a bare `swarm_language: 0.1` (a number with no discriminator) is a `SOL-S…`-class frontmatter diagnostic (the `SOL-S` structural lint layer; see [`./errors.md`](./errors.md)). The framework/package version is **never** written in per-file frontmatter, and (per [ADR-0050](../adrs/0050-swarm-is-a-spec-repo-discipline.md)) an adopted project keeps no version file at all — it is a producer release tag.
