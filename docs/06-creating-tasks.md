# Creating tasks

*Works today — plain markdown plus your agent; no Corpus tooling required.*

A task is a packet of bounded work for one agent or developer: which requirements to implement,
which files it touches, what must not change, how each requirement gets verified. The spec says
what should be true. The task hands one slice of it to one pair of hands.

The handoff is where agent work goes wrong. Ambiguous or incomplete task input measurably degrades
agent code correctness [[ORCHID]](research/sources.md#ORCHID)
[[HUMANEVALCOMM]](research/sources.md#HUMANEVALCOMM). Preliminary evidence places the
planner-to-coder handoff as the dominant failure surface in multi-agent code generation
[[PLANCODER]](research/sources.md#PLANCODER). The packet is that handoff, written down where you
can inspect it.

## The template

Copy [`templates/task.md`](https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm-starter-kit/blob/main/templates/task.md) into
`tasks/` in your workspace (see [Where files live](03-where-files-live.md)). The template is the
format. Here is what each part carries:

| Section            | What it carries                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source             | The spec the task implements — and the change plan, when it executes one of its waves           |
| Scope              | "Implement or preserve": the requirement and guarantee ids this task owns                       |
| Do not change      | The scope wall (below)                                                                          |
| Affected areas     | The files you expect to change — what keeps parallel tasks apart                                |
| Verify             | One runnable command per requirement                                                            |
| Agent instructions | The standing rules every agent follows; they ship in the template — don't rewrite them per task |
| Findings           | Anything durable discovered along the way, saved to `findings/` at Close                        |
| Run summary        | The handoff digest filled at run's end — changed files, per-command results citing the Verify pastes, out-of-scope edits, blocked questions; it cites the evidence, never re-pastes it |

## Sources and scope

A task's `source` names a spec, a change plan, or both. Its `scope` lists the ids it owns:

- **From a spec** — requirement ids (`AC-001`, `AC-002`): behavior to _implement_.
- **From a [change plan](05-brownfield-and-change-plans.md)** — preservation guarantee ids:
  behavior to _preserve_ while the structure underneath changes.

A task never adds requirements of its own. If it needs something no listed requirement covers, the
agent stops and says why. The fix is a spec amendment, not improvisation.

## Keep the task small, single-concern, and untangled

The best-replicated result in code review: **small changes get reviewed well and large ones do
not.** Useful comments drop as a change touches more files
[[BOSU15]](research/sources.md#BOSU15). Modern review has converged on a few tens of lines
[[RIGBY13]](research/sources.md#RIGBY13). A large vendor case study puts the practical ceiling
around 200–400 LOC [[SMARTBEAR]](research/sources.md#SMARTBEAR) — a heuristic with provenance, not a
measured optimum. Shape each task to one concern:

- **One concern per task.** A single requirement-cluster, not a grab-bag — if you can't name its
  scope in one line, split it.
- **Separate the refactor from the behavior change.** A rename or move lands in its own task and
  commit, ahead of the feature or fix it enables [[GOOGLESMALLCL]](research/sources.md#GOOGLESMALLCL).
  Mixing them makes a diff unreviewable. A trivial cleanup (a local rename) may ride along.
- **Split out the connective tissue.** New code often must be wired into existing code. Make the
  wiring — the high-diffusion edits touching many existing files — its own task. Logic and
  integration then review separately, not as one tangled blob.

Splitting buys *cleaner* reviews — fewer false positives at the same defect yield
[[DIBIASE19]](research/sources.md#DIBIASE19) — **not** more bugs caught. That is reason enough. A
task running well past the band above is a candidate to split. `swarm check` is the natural home for
an **advisory** oversized-packet flag (a heuristic with provenance, never an enforced limit). These
are conventions the review packet inspects; nothing enforces them at edit time
([ADR-0094](adrs/0094-decomposition-and-risk-weighted-review.md)).

Fill Verify with real commands, not intentions. Executable acceptance criteria are the part an
agent benefits from most. A runnable check outperforms prose plans as task input (preliminary
evidence) [[ORACLESWE]](research/sources.md#ORACLESWE): the requirement whose check the agent can
run is the one most likely to come back done. Where no command can exist — a physical-rig check, a
visual pass — name the manual check. Its evidence is a named human's recorded observation.

Two cases need a word before you write the Verify line.

- **A rare runtime state** (a stall, a race, a hard-to-trigger error path) needs a **simulation or
  fixture strategy** named in the task — how the agent will induce the state. Without one the agent
  can only inspect code, and the row is honestly Blocked, not Pass. The states that bite hardest and
  ship uninduced most often: **browser-extension lifecycle** (install, update, a permission prompt),
  **local model loading** (a slow or failed WebLLM/WebGPU init), a **streaming** response mid-flight,
  a **stall or timeout**, a **denied permission**, a **failure-then-recovery** path. When the
  behavior lives in the real runtime, induce it. Code inspection is not proof the state was reached
  ([Reviewing output](08-reviewing-output.md) holds the row Unverified until the runtime evidence is
  attached).
- **A check with a foundational precondition** (the extension must register before any popup
  assertion; the service must boot before any endpoint test) makes that precondition **its own first
  requirement**. A dependent check then reads Blocked — truth unknown — not a misleading Fail.

If the task may run a repo-wide auto-fixer (formatter, import sorter, codemod), say so, and have the
worker land a **mechanical-only commit before any behaviour-bearing change**. Otherwise the fix
arrives as one large mixed diff the reviewer can't read. Most tasks should not run repo-wide fixers
at all; that is a "Do not change" by default.

## "Do not change" is the scope wall

The most valuable lines in a task packet are often the ones about what _not_ to do. Name what is
adjacent and tempting: the shared utility the agent will want to "improve while in there", the
public interface that looks refactorable, the config that belongs to another team.

The wall is a convention; nothing enforces it. The [review packet](08-reviewing-output.md) backs it
up as a checklist item. Out-of-scope changes are a standing exception trigger, so a breach is routed
to a human instead of merged quietly.

## Splitting work across tasks

One task goes to one agent. To run two at the same time, keep them **write-disjoint**: parallel
tasks should not touch the same files. Compare their Affected areas before you start. If they
overlap, or both need a shared file (a schema, a route table, a central config), the shared part
serializes — one task goes first, the other waits for its merge.

That is the whole rule. The formal version — read/write conflict rules, dependency ordering, when
"different file names" still collide — lives in
[the advanced lifecycle](reference/advanced-lifecycle.md). You don't need it for a handful of tasks.

In a multi-repo workspace, an Affected-areas entry may carry a **context prefix** — exactly a
Commands sub-heading's context name (`### Commands (web)` → `web: src/checkout/…`) — binding the
task to that sub-table for its Verify commands. A task names at most one context; entries that span
contexts are the signal to split. The prefix is task-body content owned by your workspace, not a
placeholder namespace from the checks contract.

For change plans, split by **wave**. The plan's Task split table already names one or more tasks per
wave, and each wave leaves the codebase green before the next begins. Don't pull tasks forward
across waves — the ordering is the plan's safety mechanism.

## How big should a task be?

**A task an agent can finish in one sitting.** One session, one branch, one review. Signs it's too
big — split it:

- Scope lists more than a handful of requirements.
- Affected areas span unrelated parts of the codebase.
- You can't name a Verify command without saying "and then…".

Too much packet is also a cost: forcing clarification onto already-clear work measurably hurts
[[HUMANEVALCOMM]](research/sources.md#HUMANEVALCOMM)
[[ASKORASSUME]](research/sources.md#ASKORASSUME). A small cleanup is still a task. A one-line
Scope, one Verify command, and an empty "Do not change" is a complete packet, not a lazy one.

**The thin path — scale the artifact set to the risk.** The smallest work earns the smallest
record. A reproduced defect rides the [bug-fix shape](examples/bug-fix.md): a spec *check* yielding
a one-line amendment to the existing spec (not a new one), plus a regression test that runs red
first. A one-line mechanical cleanup is the one-Scope task above. A separate spec, an
[inventory, or a change plan](05-brownfield-and-change-plans.md) is **earned by risk or spread**,
not written by default. The test never changes: write exactly enough that a reviewer can map
evidence to intent — no more. Over-papering a two-line fix fails the same way under-specifying a
migration does, pointed the other way.
