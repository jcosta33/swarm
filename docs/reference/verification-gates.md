# 📖 Reference: Verification gates

> The named gate slots and when each fires. The gates are *what the framework names*; the *commands* are project-bound (see [`template-placeholders.md`](template-placeholders.md)).

> **The required suite per task type is canonical in [`flow-graph.md`](flow-graph.md)** ("Task type → verification commands"); this page defines what each gate *is*. Both bind through `AGENTS.md > Commands` ([ADR 0021](../adrs/0021-verification-contract.md)). Toolchain gates (lint, typecheck, dependency-flow, test, build) prove the code is *well-formed and the existing suite passes*; the **spec-intent and equivalence gates** below ([ADR 0022](../adrs/0022-acceptance-criteria-are-executable-checks.md)) verify the code does *what the spec intended* — the difference between toolchain health and correctness.

## 🚦 Gate phases

| Phase                   | When it fires                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pre-implementation**  | Before the agent edits code                                  |
| **Periodic**            | At checkpoints during execution (e.g., every 10 files)       |
| **Post-implementation** | After all changes                                            |
| **Self-review**         | At task close, pasted into the hard gate                     |

## 🌐 Universal gates (every code-producing task)

These slots are present on every task that produces code:

| Slot                | Phase                           | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `git-status`        | post-implementation, self-review | Only intended files changed; no orphans              |
| `{{cmdLint}}`       | post-implementation             | Lint passes                                           |
| `{{cmdFormat}}`     | post-implementation             | Format check passes                                   |
| `{{cmdTypecheck}}`  | post-implementation             | Static analysis passes                                |
| `{{cmdValidate}}`   | post-implementation, periodic   | Catch-all check (often = lint + format + typecheck)   |

A repo that lacks a particular gate (e.g., no architectural validation tooling) marks the slot `n/a` with a one-line justification rather than silently skipping it.

## 🎯 Spec-intent & equivalence gates ([ADR 0022](../adrs/0022-acceptance-criteria-are-executable-checks.md))

Toolchain gates prove form, not intent. These gates verify the output against what the source doc actually asked for. They are the framework's answer to "the suite is green, but is it *correct*?"

| Slot                         | Phase             | Tasks                          | Purpose                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `acceptance-criteria-coverage` | self-review     | feature, integration           | Each acceptance criterion maps to its check binding (`test` / `command` / `manual`-with-reason) and a pasted result; `test`-bound criteria are shown to be valid oracles (fail-then-pass / assertion-flip), not tautologies |
| `behaviour-preservation`     | post + self-review | refactor, migration, rewrite   | Equivalence shown by a check that would *fail if behaviour changed*. The existing suite passing is necessary but not sufficient — name a property-based / differential / golden-output check where available, or record explicitly why the existing suite is a sufficient oracle for this change |
| `integration-boundary`       | self-review       | integration                    | Secrets resolve via scoped env vars (a `grep` proves none hardcoded); the SDK/API version is pinned and documented; a contract/integration test exercises the boundary |

These are the criteria-level oracle ([0022](../adrs/0022-acceptance-criteria-are-executable-checks.md)) layered on top of the toolchain suite ([0021](../adrs/0021-verification-contract.md)). Where no executable check is possible, the `manual`-with-reason form is the honest fallback — the gate records *that* a human must judge it, rather than pretending a test covers it.

---

## 🛡️ The hard gate

Every Self-review section in every task template includes:

> **Hard gate.** The task is not complete until every question below has a written answer directly beneath it. An unanswered question is a skipped check.

The hard gate is the framework's structural defence against hallucinated completion. The agent cannot mark `status: done` without filling in every `[Paste output]` placeholder with verbatim verification output.

See [`concepts/09-empirical-proof.md`](../concepts/09-empirical-proof.md) and [`skills/empirical-proof.md`](../skills/empirical-proof.md).

---

## 🧯 When a gate can't be run

If the agent legitimately can't produce a verification (env issue, missing tool, hardware unavailable):

```markdown
- `{{cmdValidateDeps}}` (last 2 lines):

  > **Could not run** — `dependency-cruiser` not installed in this worktree.
  > See `## Blockers` for follow-up.
```

And in `## Blockers`:

```markdown
- `{{cmdValidateDeps}}` not runnable — `dependency-cruiser` missing. Either install
  it (preferred) or mark the slot `n/a` for this task type with a one-line justification.
```

The blocker is real and visible; the gate isn't bypassed silently.
